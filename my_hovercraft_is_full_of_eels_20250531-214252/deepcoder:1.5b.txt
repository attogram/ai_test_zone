It seems like you're trying to describe your hovercraft in a playful way by saying "full of eels." However, I don't have access to the internal workings of hovercrafts or specific details about the content inside. If you're describing a scenario or concept related to hovercrafts, feel free to clarify, and I can help elaborate! For example:

- How does a hovercraft float?
- What materials are used in hovercraft construction?
- Can hovercrafts survive long periods without power?

Let me know how I can assist further!
