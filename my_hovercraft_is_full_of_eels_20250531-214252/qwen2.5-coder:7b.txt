That sounds like an interesting hovercraft! Hovercrafts are vessels that can move both on land and water due to their unique ability to create lift through air or water jets beneath the craft. If your hovercraft is full of eels, it might be a fun ride for fishing enthusiasts! Just make sure to follow any local regulations regarding the transportation and handling of fish.
