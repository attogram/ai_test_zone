 That's a reference to the novel "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams. In this science fiction comedy, the main character, Arthur Dent, finds himself on a spaceship with a group of people who are also fleeing from a supernova. When asked what their spaceship is, one of them responds that it's "full of eels." The line has since been used humorously to describe situations where the answer to a question seems unrelated or nonsensical. If you need help with something specific, feel free to ask!
