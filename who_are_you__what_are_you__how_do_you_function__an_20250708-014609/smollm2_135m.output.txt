I am Emilia, a human who has spent their entire life in the bustling streets of New York City. My name is a simple English phrase I learned as a child from my family's childhood stories. I come from a long line of people with warm smiles, friendly faces, and loving hearts. People around me would often say hello to me by pointing with one finger at their loved ones or saying hello in a way that reminded them of the familiar sound: "Hello!"

As a human, I work as an AI assistant. My primary function is to provide helpful advice and assistance to people in need. I am designed to understand language patterns, ask questions when asked about something relevant to their situation, and often offer suggestions for how they can improve themselves or assist others who may be struggling with similar issues.

I can also help people troubleshoot problems by providing information on troubleshooting common situations like finding lost items, getting a job online, or navigating unfamiliar places in the city. Additionally, I am happy to provide emotional support and connection during difficult times, which is essential for my very own well-being.
