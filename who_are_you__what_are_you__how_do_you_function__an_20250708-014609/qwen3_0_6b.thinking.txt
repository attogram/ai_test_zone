Okay, the user is asking a series of questions: "Who are you, What are you, How do you function, and What can you do?" They want me to respond to each of these questions. Let me break it down.

First, "Who are you?" I should acknowledge that I'm a language model, not a person. I need to explain that I don't have a physical form or a personal identity. Then, "What are you?" I'll mention my purpose as an AI that can process information and assist users. Next, "How do you function?" I should explain that I use algorithms and machine learning to perform tasks. Finally, "What can you do?" I'll list the capabilities, like answering questions, providing information, and helping with tasks. I should make sure each response is clear and addresses each question directly. Let me check if I'm using the right terms and if the structure is correct.
