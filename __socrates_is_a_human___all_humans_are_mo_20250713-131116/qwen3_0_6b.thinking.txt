Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether Socrates is mortal based on the given statements. Let me break this down.

First, the user provided three statements: Socrates is a human, all humans are mortal, and they want to know if Socrates is mortal. 

So, starting with the first statement, Socrates is a human. That's straightforward. Now, the second statement says all humans are mortal. Mortality is a shared characteristic of all humans. So, if all humans are mortal, then Socrates, being a human, must be mortal. That seems direct. 

Wait, but maybe I should check if there's any ambiguity. For example, are there exceptions or other factors? The problem is presented in a logical form, so it's assuming universal truths. All humans are mortal, so if Socrates is human, he's mortal. That seems to check out. 

Is there any possibility that Socrates isn't mortal? Like, maybe he's a non-human or something? But the problem doesn't mention that. It's given that Socrates is a human, and all humans are mortal. Therefore, by the laws of logic, Socrates must be mortal. 

I think that's it. The answer should be yes, Socrates is mortal.
