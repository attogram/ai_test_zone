Okay, so I need to figure out if Socrates is mortal based on the given premises. Let's start by breaking down the information provided.

First, the premises are:
1. Socrates is a human.
2. All humans are mortal.

The question is: Is Socrates mortal?

Hmm, this seems like a classic example of a syllogism. A syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning where you draw a conclusion from two premises. Let me recall the structure. A standard syllogism has a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. In this case, the major premise is "All humans are mortal," and the minor premise is "Socrates is a human." The conclusion would then be "Therefore, Socrates is mortal."

Wait, but I should make sure that the premises are correctly structured. The first premise is about Socrates being a human, which is a specific instance. The second premise is a general statement about all humans. So combining them, if all humans are mortal and Socrates is a human, then logically, Socrates must be mortal.

But maybe I should check if there's any possibility of an exception. The premises don't mention any exceptions. The second premise says "All humans are mortal," which is a universal statement. Unless there's a hidden assumption or a trick in the question, but I don't think so. The question seems straightforward.

Another way to think about it is using set theory. If the set of humans is a subset of the set of mortals, then every member of the human set must also be a member of the mortal set. Since Socrates is in the human set, he must be in the mortal set. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

I wonder if there's any philosophical debate about this. For example, some might argue about the definition of "mortal," but the premises take "mortal" as given. Since the premises state that all humans are mortal, we have to accept that definition for the sake of the argument.

Also, considering the historical context, Socrates was a real person, and in reality, he was indeed mortal. But the question here is based on the logical structure, not historical facts. Even if in reality Socrates was mortal, the conclusion is derived from the premises provided, not external knowledge.

Wait, but what if the premises are not entirely accurate? For example, if "All humans are mortal" is not a universal truth. However, the problem states these premises as given, so we can't question their validity. We have to take them as true for the purpose of the logical deduction.

So, putting it all together: From the premises, we can apply deductive reasoning to conclude that Socrates is mortal. There's no ambiguity here because the premises are clear and the logic follows directly. Therefore, the answer should be yes, Socrates is mortal.
