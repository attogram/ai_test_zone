Okay, so I need to figure out if Socrates is mortal based on the given premises. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the premises are:
1. Socrates is a human.
2. All humans are mortal.

The question is whether Socrates is mortal. 

Hmm, so if Socrates is a human, and all humans are mortal, then by logical deduction, Socrates should be mortal. That seems straightforward. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any nuance here. 

Let me recall the syllogism structure. A syllogism is an argument with two premises and a conclusion. In this case, the first premise is a specific statement (Socrates is a human), and the second is a general statement (all humans are mortal). The conclusion would be that Socrates is mortal. 

So applying the syllogism here: All A (humans) are B (mortal). C (Socrates) is A. Therefore, C is B. That's a classic syllogism, so the conclusion should follow logically. 

But maybe there's something I'm missing. Like, is there any possibility that the premises are not true? Well, the problem states them as given, so I have to assume they're true. 

Another angle: in real life, Socrates was a historical figure and indeed mortal. But the question is about logical deduction, not real-world facts. So even if in reality Socrates was mortal, the logic here is that the premises lead to the conclusion. 

Wait, could there be a case where even if all humans are mortal, Socrates isn't? Like if Socrates isn't a human? But the first premise says he is. So the conclusion must be that he is mortal. 

I think that's it. The answer is yes, Socrates is mortal based on the premises given.
