This is a classic philosophical thought experiment! Here’s the breakdown:

*   **Socrates is a human.** This is a factual statement.
*   **All humans are mortal.** This is also a factual statement, derived from the premise that Socrates is a human.

**Therefore, based on these two statements, we *can* conclude that Socrates is mortal.**

However, this isn't a definitive answer. The statement about mortality is about *humans* in general, not specifically about Socrates. Socrates is a unique individual, and we don't have definitive proof of his immortality. 

It’s a tricky philosophical point!
