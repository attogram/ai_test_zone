First, the user gives two premises:

1. Socrates is a human.

2. All humans are mortal.

Then they ask: "Is Socrates mortal?"

This is a classic syllogism in logic. The question is essentially asking for the conclusion based on these premises.

The logical structure here is straightforward. If something belongs to a group, and all members of that group have a certain property, then it has that property.

So:

- All humans are mortal (universal affirmative).

- Socrates is a human (affirmative statement about an individual).

Therefore, Socrates must be mortal.

I need to reason step by step as per the instruction. Also, since this is based on given premises, I should ensure that there's no trick here or any additional information that might change things.

The user says: "Socrates is a human." and "All humans are mortal." These are facts from ancient philosophy; Socrates was indeed a human, and it's commonly accepted that all humans are mortal. But in this context, I think we're to treat them as premises for logical deduction.

There's no contradiction or anything missing here. The answer should be yes, based on the premises provided.

But let me make sure about the syllogism: It's a categorical syllogism with two premises and a conclusion.

Premise 1: Socrates is human (particular affirmative).

In standard terms:

- Major premise: All humans are mortal. (∀x Human(x) → Mortal(x))

- Minor premise: Socrates is human. (Human(Socrates))

Therefore, Conclusion: Socrates is mortal. (∃x Socrates and Human(x) → Mortal(Socrates))

Since the minor premise specifies that Socrates falls under the category of humans, and all humans are mortal, it follows.

The user might be testing if I understand basic logic or if there's any fallacy here. But this seems solid.

Also, consider if "all humans" includes everyone who has ever lived or only current ones? The statement says "all humans," which in philosophy typically refers to the concept of humanity as a whole, so it should include historical figures like Socrates.

There are no exceptions mentioned; it's a general rule.

Therefore, based on this reasoning, Socrates is mortal.

Now, for my response: I need to be clear and logical. Since the user said "Socrates is a human," that establishes his membership in the set of humans.

Then, from the second premise, all members are mortal, so yes.

I should phrase it properly.
