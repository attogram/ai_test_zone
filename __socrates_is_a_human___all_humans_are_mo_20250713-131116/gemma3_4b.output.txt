Yes, Socrates is mortal. 

This is a classic example of a deductive argument, specifically a syllogism:

*   **Premise 1:** Socrates is a human.
*   **Premise 2:** All humans are mortal.
*   **Conclusion:** Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

Because the premises are true, the conclusion *must* be true.
