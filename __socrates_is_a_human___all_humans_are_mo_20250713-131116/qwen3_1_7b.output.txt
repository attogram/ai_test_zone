Based on the given premises:

1. **Socrates is a human.**  
2. **All humans are mortal.**  

Logical deduction applies here. If all humans are mortal (a universal statement), and Socrates is a human (a specific instance), then **Socrates must be mortal**. This follows from **modus ponens** (if P then Q; P is true â†’ Q is true).  

**Answer:** Yes, Socrates is mortal.
