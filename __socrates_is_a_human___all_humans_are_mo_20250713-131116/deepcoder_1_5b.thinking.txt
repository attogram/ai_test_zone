Okay, so I need to figure out if Socrates is mortal based on the given statements. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the statement says, "Socrates is a human." So that means Socrates belongs to the category of humans. Now, the second part is, "All humans are mortal." That sounds like a universal statement, meaning every single person who is a human is also a mortal being.

So if I have Socrates as a human, and all humans are mortal, then by applying the second statement to Socrates, it must follow that Socrates is mortal. It's like using a rule of inference where if something is in category A and all members of A are in category B, then anything in A is in B.

I think that makes sense because Socrates being human directly fits into the "all humans are mortal" statement, so there's no exception or something outside those categories. Therefore, logically, it should follow that Socrates is mortal.
