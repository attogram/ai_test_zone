Thinking...
Okay, I need to write a PHP function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list of its contents. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function needs to accept an array as input. So maybe I'll use a parameter like $array. Then, I need to generate an HTML list. In HTML, lists are created with <ul> and <li> tags. So for each element in the array, I should create a list item.

Wait, but how do I loop through the array in PHP? Oh right, using a foreach loop. So I can loop through each element of the array and output the corresponding <li> tags.

So the function would start by defining the function, maybe something like function generateHtmlList($array) { ... }

Inside the function, I'll use a foreach loop. For each $item in $array, I'll echo a <li> tag with the $item inside. Then close the list with </ul> after all items are processed.

But I should also make sure that the array is not empty. Oh, but the problem statement says "take in an array", so maybe the function should handle any array, including empty ones. But maybe the user expects that the array is valid. So perhaps just loop through it regardless.

So the code would be:

function generateHtmlList($array) {
    echo '<ul>';
    foreach ($array as $item) {
        echo '<li>' . $item . '</li>';
    }
    echo '</ul>';
}

Wait, but what if the array has nested arrays? The problem statement says "array contents", so maybe it's just the elements, not nested. But the function as written would handle nested arrays as well, since each element is iterated over.

But the problem says "output a html list of the array contents", so perhaps the function should handle nested arrays as well. But the question doesn't specify, so maybe just assume that the input is a flat array.

So the function as written should work. Let me test with an example. If the array is ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], the output would be <ul><li>apple</li><li>banana</li><li>cherry</li></ul>.

Yes. So that's the function. But maybe the user wants to handle cases where the array is empty? Well, the function would output an empty ul, which is correct.

So the code should be as written. I think that's it.
...done thinking.

To create a PHP function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list of its contents, you can follow the structure below. This function assumes the input array is a flat array (i.e., not nested), and it will generate a `<ul>` list with corresponding `<li>` elements for each item in the array.

### ‚úÖ Function Definition

```php
function generateHtmlList($array) {
    echo '<ul>';
    foreach ($array as $item) {
        echo '<li>' . $item . '</li>';
    }
    echo '</ul>';
}
```

### üîç How It Works

- **Input**: The function takes an array as a single parameter.
- **Loop**: It uses a `foreach` loop to iterate over each element in the array.
- **Output**: For each element, it generates a `<li>` tag with the element's value.
- **Structure**: The function starts with `<ul>` and ends with `</ul>` to create a properly formatted unordered list.

### üß™ Example Usage

```php
$fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
generateHtmlList($fruits);
```

**Output:**

```html
<ul>
<li>apple</li>
<li>banana</li>
<li>cherry</li>
</ul>
```

### üìå Notes

- The function handles empty arrays gracefully, outputting an empty `<ul>`.
- It does **not** handle nested arrays, as the problem statement implies a flat input.
- The function assumes the input array is valid and well-formed.

This implementation is simple, efficient, and meets the basic requirement of generating an HTML list from an input array.
