solutions to a non-linear second-order ordinary di fferential equation called the Van der Pol-von Neumann equati on for which we have the following boundary condition sThe system can also be treated by a linearized version of the VDP- equation for small amplitudes . The VDP-e quation is an example of a limit cycle phenomenon. A limit c ycle arises in differential equations such as those that are solvabl e only by solving them backward in time, i.e., "backwards". It has periodic solution s which return to the initial state after some time period.T he system can be interpreted as having an oscillatory motion with a stable attractor and saddle point. The s ystem is also equivalent to the following system (2)D yn amic al ly , t he V DP equa tion is equivalent to a set of two coupled nonlinear d ifferential equationsThe first equation describes a nonl inear harmonic oscillator with damping, while the second one des cribes an undamped harmonic oscillator. The last term is a constant. In order to simplify our analysis further we can eliminate this cons tant from the system by a transformation.The lineariz ed version of the VDP- equation is the followingThe stability of fixed point s and periodic orbits in this system ha s been studied in depth with a special emphasis on t he existence of periodic solutions. A set of conditions for the existence of p eriodic or r egular solution s are given belowIn th e context of our analysis we consider the following conditions:Asym ptotic stability.For an orbit {x(t),t≥ t0} to be stably attract ing, it must satisfy the following conditio ns:For the origin and for any other fixed point in the system, the origin is stable if all the fixed points in the system are stable. To give a more concrete idea of what is meant by stability, we consider an orbit {x(t),t≥ t0} as a set of points {x1(x1(t)),t≥ t0) , {x2(x2(t)),t≥ t0)} and so on. The orbit will be stable if it is not possible for the system to move away from this orbit once it has been reached. In other words, once the origin or a fixed point of the system has been reached it will remain there forever.Furthermor e, any periodic orbit with a period T, i.e., {x(t+ nT)} is stable if the following condition is satisfied:For a given initial state {x0(t)} with t0=0, we consider the evolution of this orbit as we move to time t1. If all the orbits starting from {x0(t0+ T)} remain in a small region around the origin or a fixed point after some ti me t2, we can conclude that the system is stable for at least t1 time steps in t he context of our analysis. If we repeat this process for multiple initial states starting from {x0(0 ),x0(-t0),x0(t0)} and so on, the system will be considered as unstable if it exhibits unstable orbits for any of these initial states starting from {x0(-t0)} or {x0(t0)} after some time t2.
