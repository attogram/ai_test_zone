Okay, the user just said "hi" and I need to respond. Let me start by acknowledging their greeting. A simple "Hello!" is a good start. Then, I should offer to help them with something they need. Maybe ask if they have any questions or need assistance. It's important to keep the conversation friendly and open-ended. Let me make sure the response is friendly and welcoming.
