Okay, the user said "hi". I need to respond appropriately. Since they didn't provide any specific query, I should keep it simple and friendly. Maybe greet them back and offer assistance. Let me make sure to use a welcoming tone and prompt them to ask anything they need help with. Avoid any markdown and keep the response natural.
