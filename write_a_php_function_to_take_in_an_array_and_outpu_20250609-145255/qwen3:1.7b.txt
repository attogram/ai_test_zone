Thinking...
Okay, I need to write a PHP function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list of its contents. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the function should accept an array as input. So maybe the function is called something like generateHtmlList or similar. The parameters would be the array. Then, I need to loop through each element of the array and create list items.

Wait, PHP has a function called array_map, but maybe I don't need that. Just a simple loop. Like, for each element in the array, create a <li> tag. Then wrap them in a <ul> tag.

So the steps are: create a UL element, then loop through each element in the array, adding a LI for each, then close the UL.

But how to structure the HTML. Let's think. The function should output the HTML directly, so maybe return the string or echo it. But the problem says "output a html list", so perhaps return the HTML string.

So the function would be something like:

function generateHtmlList($array) {
    $html = '<ul>';
    foreach ($array as $item) {
        $html .= '<li>' . $item . '</li>';
    }
    $html .= '</ul>';
    return $html;
}

Wait, but what if the array is empty? Well, the function would return an empty UL, which is okay. But maybe the user expects to handle empty arrays? Well, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps just proceed as is.

Testing this function: if the input is an array like [1,2,3], it should return <ul><li>1</li><li>2</li><li>3</li></ul>.

Yes. So that's the basic idea. But maybe the user wants to handle different types of elements? Like if the array has strings, numbers, etc. But the function would just output them as is, assuming that the elements are printable as HTML.

So the function is straightforward. Just loop through the array, create li tags, wrap in ul.

I think that's it. Let me write the code.
...done thinking.

To create a PHP function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list of its contents, we can follow a simple and effective approach. The function will:

1. Accept an array as input.
2. Generate an unordered list (`<ul>`) element.
3. Loop through each element of the array.
4. For each element, create a list item (`<li>`) and append it to the HTML string.
5. Close the `<ul>` element and return the resulting HTML string.

Here's the complete and well-documented PHP function:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Generates an HTML unordered list from an array.
 *
 * @param array $array The input array to be converted into an HTML list.
 * @return string The HTML string representing the list.
 */
function generateHtmlList(array $array): string
{
    // Start the unordered list
    $html = '<ul>';

    // Loop through each element in the array
    foreach ($array as $item) {
        // Create a list item and append it to the HTML string
        $html .= '<li>' . htmlspecialchars($item) . '</li>';
    }

    // Close the unordered list
    $html .= '</ul>';

    return $html;
}
```

### Example Usage

```php
$items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];
echo generateHtmlList($items);
```

This will output:

```html
<ul>
<li>Apple</li>
<li>Banana</li>
<li>Cherry</li>
</ul>
```

### Notes

- The function uses `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent XSS attacks, ensuring that any special characters in the array elements are properly escaped.
- The function assumes that the array elements are safe and can be directly included in HTML without further processing.
- If the array is empty, the output will be an empty `<ul>` tag, which is valid HTML.

This solution is clean, efficient, and handles various types of input arrays gracefully.
