**This script provides a comprehensive framework for setting up and running OLLAMA models with a custom prompt. It includes:**

* Functions for parsing command line arguments
* Sub-functions for setting model, prompt and results directories, saving prompt, setting system stats, creating results index file, and creating index file
* Sub-function for adding models to the index file
* Functions for cleaning up temporary files and directories
* A main function that runs the entire pipeline for a set of models

**Note:**

* This script requires the `ollama` command to be installed on the system.
* The `RESULTS_DIRECTORY` environment variable should be set to the desired location for the results.
* The `OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS` and `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` environment variables control the maximum number of loaded models and whether to keep the model alive between runs, respectively.
