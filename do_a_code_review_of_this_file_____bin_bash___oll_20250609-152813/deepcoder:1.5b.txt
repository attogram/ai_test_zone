Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to write the code for this Python script based on the provided problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the user has given a lot of code snippets and instructions. The main task is to create a Python script that handles several functionalities related to models, stats, and output files. The script needs to manage directories, handle HTML files, process images, and so on.

Let me start by understanding each part of the problem.

1. **Model Handling and Indexing:**
   - There are functions like `createModelFile`, which create HTML pages for model information, responses, etc.
   - The script should loop through each model in the `models` directory, run it with a given prompt, collect stats, and generate HTML files for results and index.

2. **Directory Management:**
   - Functions like `addModelToIndexFile` add model entries to an index file.
   - There's also a function `finishIndexFile` which might handle the finalizing of all index files.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The script should create HTML pages for results and output, including showing some statistics like words, bytes, etc.

4. **Image Processing:**
   - Functions like `showImages` generate images from a file, but in this case, it's shown that the images are read from another directory, so perhaps there's an issue here or maybe it's handled differently.

5. **External Programs:**
   - The `ollama` command is used, which suggests that some parts of the script need to interact with external tools like Ollama.

Looking at the provided code, I see several functions defined for HTML generation, image handling, and model operations. The main script needs to export these values into specific directories and handle all the logic step by step.

Let me outline the steps the script should take:

- **Export Values:**
  - Export `responseWords`, `responseBytes`, etc., into `results` directory.
  - For each model, collect stats and generate HTML files for results and index.

- **Run Models:**
  - Loop through each model in `models` directory.
  - Execute the model with a prompt using Ollama.
  - After execution, process the output to get statistics and save them.

- **Generate HTML Files:**
  - Create HTML pages for model responses, results, etc., using functions like `createResultPage`, `createResultsIndexFile`, etc.

Now, let's think about how to structure this in code. The main function will likely export all the necessary values into specific directories and then loop through each model, execute it, process the output, and update the statistics accordingly.

I need to make sure that:

- All necessary directories are created if they don't exist.
- Each model is processed only once per run.
- The stats are correctly captured and passed along with any generated HTML files.

Let me consider writing a function `export_values` that exports all calculated values into `results/{tag}.html`, which can be done in the main script after processing each model.

Another important part is handling the Ollama command. Since it's used for running models, perhaps there's an option or command-line flag that needs to be set when starting the process. But looking at the provided code, I see `setOllamaStats` which runs a specific model with stats as input. So maybe each model run will pass some parameters.

I also need to make sure that all functions are properly exported and that any required libraries or modules are included, but since this is just code writing, perhaps it's handled within the script without external dependencies beyond what's given.

Now, putting it all together, I'll structure the Python code as follows:

1. Define a function `export_values` to create HTML files for results.
2. Loop through each model in the models directory.
3. For each model:
   - Check if the model exists and is not empty.
   - Execute Ollama command with appropriate arguments (prompt, stats file).
   - Use setModelInfo to update statistics.
   - Generate HTML pages for results and index based on stats.
4. Clear the current model's info after processing.

I also need to make sure that all necessary imports are included if any new modules are added, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume basic Python functions.

In summary, the main steps involve exporting values, looping through models, executing them, generating HTML files, and ensuring all parts of the process are correctly integrated into a single script.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to create a Python script that handles multiple functionalities related to model processing, statistics, and output generation. The script will loop through each model in a specified directory, run it with a given prompt, collect statistics, and generate HTML files for results and index.

### Approach
1. **Export Values:** Create functions to export values like words, bytes, total duration, etc., into specific directories.
2. **Run Models:** Loop through each model in the `models` directory, execute it using Ollama, collect statistics, and update statistics variables.
3. **Generate HTML Files:** Use defined functions to create HTML files for results and index based on collected statistics.
4. **Clear Model Information:** After processing each model, clear its information from the console.

### Explanation
1. **Export Values:** The `export_values` function generates HTML pages for results based on collected statistics.
2. **Run Models:** Each model is executed, and its output is used to update statistics. After execution, the script updates the statistics in a dictionary.
3. **Generate HTML Files:** Functions create HTML files for both results and index based on the collected data.
4. **Clear Model Information:** After processing each model, it clears the current information from the console.

This approach ensures that all necessary functionalities are handled efficiently, including loop iterations, model execution, statistics management, and HTML generation.
