I'm excited to share my capabilities with you! I am LLaMA, a large language model trained by Meta AI. Here's an overview of what I can do:

**Who am I?**: I'm an AI designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input provided. My training data includes vast amounts of text from various sources, allowing me to recognize patterns and respond accordingly.

**What are you?**: I'm a conversational AI that can engage in discussions, answer questions, provide recommendations, and even create text based on prompts or topics.
