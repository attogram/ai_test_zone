Okay, I need to write a JavaScript function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list of its contents. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should consider how HTML lists are structured. In HTML, a list can be created using either unordered or ordered lists. Since the example given uses <ul> for an unordered list, maybe I'll go with that structure.

So, the function will take an array as input. Let's name it something like 'array' and turn it into an HTML list element. Each item in the array should be a list item within this ul tag.

I remember that to create a new list item in HTML, you use <li> tags. So each element of the array will become a <li> with the corresponding value.

Now, how to structure the code. The function will probably start by creating an <ul> element. Then, loop through each item in the input array and append each as a <li> inside the ul.

I should also consider any necessary styling or attributes. For simplicity, maybe just include each item without additional classes or IDs. So each <li> will have an empty content tag for now.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this:

1. Create an empty <ul> element.
2. Iterate over each element in the input array.
3. For each element, append a <li> with the element's value.
4. Return the resulting HTML list.

I should also think about edge cases, like empty arrays or non-string elements. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume the input is a valid array of strings.

Testing the function with an example: if the input is ['First', 'Second', 'Third'], the output should be an unordered list with each word as a list item.

So, writing the code step by step:

- Function definition: function createHTMLList(arr) {}
- Create the ul element: const html = new Node('ul');
- Loop through arr: for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
   - Append li with arr[i]: html.appendChild(new Node('<li>' + arr[i] + '</li>'));
- Return the html variable.

Wait, but in JavaScript, creating elements is done using new Node. Alternatively, maybe just create string elements directly. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use document.createElement to create HTML elements. Because in JSX, we can't have nested nodes easily, so perhaps using document.createElement for each part.

Alternatively, since this is a simple function, maybe using the <li> tags directly without wrapping them in nodes might be sufficient, but probably not. Let me think again.

If I use the new Node approach, each li would be an element inside the ul. But perhaps it's better to create each as separate elements within the parent structure.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to construct each part as strings and then wrap them in appropriate HTML tags. Alternatively, maybe just create each li directly without wrapping.

Alternatively, perhaps using the following approach:

function createHTMLList(arr) {
   const html = document.createElement('ul');
   for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      html.appendChild(document.createElement('<li>' + arr[i] + '</li>');
   }
   return html;
}

But wait, if I do that, each li will have the content as it is. But perhaps in this case, since the function is to output a list of array contents, maybe just append each item directly without any additional attributes.

Alternatively, perhaps using an empty string for attributes and leaving them empty.

So, putting it all together, the function would create an unordered list with each element from the array as a list item.

Testing this logic: if arr is ['First', 'Second'], then the HTML should be:

<ul>
  <li>First</li>
  <li>Second</li>
</ul>

Which is what the code would produce.

So, writing the function accordingly.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to create a JavaScript function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list of its contents. This will be achieved by constructing an unordered list using HTML elements within a `<ul>` tag.

### Approach
1. **Understand HTML List Structure**: An unordered list in HTML can be created using the `<ul>` (Unordered List) element, which contains `<li>` (List Item) elements.
2. **Initialize the Root Element**: Start by creating an empty `<ul>` element to serve as the root of our list.
3. **Iterate Through the Array**: For each item in the input array, create a `<li>` element and append it to the main `<ul>` element.
4. **Return the Result**: After processing all items, return the constructed HTML content.

This approach ensures that each element from the array is correctly placed within an unordered list structure, making it easy to visualize and understand the sequence of elements.

### Solution Code
```javascript
function createHTMLList(array) {
    const html = document.createElement('ul');
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        html.appendChild(document.createElement('<li>' + array[i] + '</li>');
    }
    return html;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The function starts by creating a new `<ul>` element to serve as the root of our list.
- **Loop Through Array**: For each item in the input array, it creates a `<li>` element and appends it to the main `<ul>` element. This is done using `document.createElement` to create individual HTML elements dynamically.
- **Return Constructed List**: After processing all items, the function returns the constructed HTML list, which includes an unordered structure with each item from the input array as a separate list item.

This method ensures that the output is clean and easy to understand, providing a clear representation of how each element in the array will appear in an HTML document.
