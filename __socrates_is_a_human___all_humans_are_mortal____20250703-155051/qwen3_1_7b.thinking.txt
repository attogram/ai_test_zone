Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Socrates is mortal based on the given premises. The premises are that Socrates is a human, and all humans are mortal. So, I need to figure out if that logically follows.

First, I remember that in logic, if all members of a set have a certain property, then any member of that set must also have that property. So if all humans are mortal, then any human, including Socrates, should be mortal. That seems straightforward.

But wait, maybe there's a trick here. Are there any exceptions? The premises don't mention any exceptions. They just state that all humans are mortal. So unless there's some hidden information, like Socrates being a special case, but the premises don't mention that. 

Also, Socrates is a human, so applying the premise directly. The first premise says Socrates is a human, the second says all humans are mortal. So by modus ponens, if P then Q, and P is true, then Q must be true. So Socrates is mortal.

But maybe the user is testing if I know that in logic, even if the premises are stated, you have to apply the rules. So the answer would be yes, Socrates is mortal. But I need to make sure there's no hidden assumption. Like, maybe the premises are in a different context? But the user provided them as facts, so I take them as given.

Another angle: in real life, Socrates was indeed mortal, but the question is about logical deduction. So the answer is based on the premises provided, not real-world knowledge. So the conclusion is logically valid.
