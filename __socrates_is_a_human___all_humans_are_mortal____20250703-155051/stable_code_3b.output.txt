No, Socrates is not mortal. This statement is based on the assumption that all humans are mortal, which is generally false. Some individuals have certain qualities or characteristics that distinguish them from others, even if they share similar biological aspects. In this case, while it might seem reasonable to assume that Socrates has qualities that distinguish him from other humans, such an assumption is not supported by any known facts or evidence regarding the subject matter under discussion.
