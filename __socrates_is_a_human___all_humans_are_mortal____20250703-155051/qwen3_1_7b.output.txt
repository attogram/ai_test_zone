Based on the given premises:

1. **Socrates is a human**  
2. **All humans are mortal**  

We can apply **modus ponens** (a valid argument form in logic):  
- If all humans are mortal (Premise 2), and Socrates is a human (Premise 1), then **Socrates is mortal** (Conclusion).  

This follows directly from the premises. There is no ambiguity or hidden exception in the provided information. The conclusion is logically derived from the premises.  

**Answer:** Yes, Socrates is mortal.
