Okay, so I need to figure out if Socrates is mortal based on the given premises. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, it says "Socrates is a human." Then, "All humans are mortal." The question is asking if Socrates is mortal. 

Let me recall some basic logic here. If all humans are mortal, then any individual who is a human should be mortal. Since Socrates is a human, by the second premise, he must be mortal. That seems straightforward. But maybe I should check if there's any hidden assumption or something I'm missing.

Wait, are there any exceptions to the statement "All humans are mortal"? Like, maybe some humans aren't mortal? But according to the premises given, that's not the case. The premises are taken as true, so I have to accept that all humans are mortal without questioning that. 

So applying the syllogism here: All humans (category) are mortal (attribute). Socrates is a member of the category "humans." Therefore, Socrates must have the attribute "mortal." That's a classic syllogism in logic. 

Is there any possibility that Socrates isn't a human? The first premise states he is a human, so that's given. So combining both premises, the conclusion follows. 

I don't think there's any ambiguity here. The premises are clear, and the logic is valid. Therefore, the answer should be yes, Socrates is mortal.
