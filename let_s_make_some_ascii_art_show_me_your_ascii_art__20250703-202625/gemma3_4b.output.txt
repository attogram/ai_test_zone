Okay, let's do this!  I'll create an ASCII art of a simple cat.  Here we go:

```
   /\_/\
  ( o.o )
  > ^ <
```

How about that?  I can try something more complex if you'd like, or something different.  Do you have a specific animal or object in mind?  Or would you like to challenge me with a more difficult shape?
