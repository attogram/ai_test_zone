Here's another example of ASCII art:
```
 _    _ 
|_|  |_|
 _   _|
 |_| |_|
```
This is a simple representation of a box with two sides labeled and a number in the middle.

You can also create more complex ASCII art by using different characters, colors, and shapes. Some examples of ASCII art include:

* A star field
* An abstract art piece
* A logo or brand identity

Here's an example of a simple ASCII art logo:
```
 _    _____
|_|  |_|  (_)
 _   _| | (_)
 |_| |_| | (_)
                                _
                               (_)
                              __  ^
                             /  \ |
                            @  @ |
                            \_  _/
                              (___^)
```
This is just a simple example, but you can create even more complex and interesting ASCII art by using different characters and shapes.

To create your own ASCII art, you can use any text editor or word processing software that allows you to insert special characters. Once you have inserted the characters for your desired design, you can save the file with a .txt or other text-based file extension.

Once you have created your ASCII art file, you can open it in any web browser to view it as an HTML document. This will allow you to customize the appearance of your ASCII art by using CSS styles and formatting.

Overall, creating ASCII art is a fun and creative way to express yourself with text-based visuals. Whether you are looking to create a simple graphic for sharing on social media or to design a complex and intricate artwork piece, there are many resources available online that can help you create your own unique ASCII art pieces.
