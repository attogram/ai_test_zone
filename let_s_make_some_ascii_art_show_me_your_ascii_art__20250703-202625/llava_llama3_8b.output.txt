Here's a simple ASCII art representation of a cat:
```lua
           / 
          / 
        _/  
        \_
        / 
```
It features a pair of ears on top and a tail at the bottom, along with a body that forms an arc with two points. The dots and slashes represent the fur on the cat. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
