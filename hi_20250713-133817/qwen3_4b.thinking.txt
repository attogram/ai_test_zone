Okay, the user said "hi" and that's it. I need to respond appropriately.

First, I should acknowledge their greeting. Maybe say "Hello!" to be friendly.

Then, I should ask how I can assist them. That way, they know I'm here to help.

I should keep it open-ended so they can tell me what they need. Maybe something like, "How can I assist you today?"

Make sure the tone is warm and welcoming. No need for any markdown, just plain text.

Check for any possible misunderstandings. Since they just said "hi," there's no specific request, so a general offer to help is good.

Avoid any technical jargon or complex language. Keep it simple and straightforward.

Alright, that should cover it. Let them know I'm here and ready to help.
