Okay, the user just said "hi". That's a greeting. I need to respond politely. Let me make sure I'm in a friendly and helpful tone.

I should acknowledge their greeting and maybe ask how I can assist them. Let me check if there's anything else they might need. Maybe offer help with whatever they're looking for. Keep it open-ended so they feel comfortable to share more. Alright, that should work.
