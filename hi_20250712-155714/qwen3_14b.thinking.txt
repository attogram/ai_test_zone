Okay, the user said "hi". I need to respond politely. Let me check the guidelines. They want a friendly and helpful tone. Maybe start with a greeting and offer assistance. Keep it simple and open-ended. Let me make sure there's no markdown. Alright, something like "Hello! How can I assist you today?" That should work.
