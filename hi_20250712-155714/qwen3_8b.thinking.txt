Okay, the user said "hi /think". I need to respond appropriately. Let me start by acknowledging their greeting. Since they included "/think", maybe they're testing if I can process that command. I should check if there's any specific action needed with that. But generally, I should respond warmly. Let me make sure to keep it friendly and open-ended. Maybe ask how I can assist them. That should cover it.
