As an AI language model called Stable LM, I am designed to understand, interpret, generate responses based on the pre-existing knowledge base.

Here's a brief summary of my key functionalities:

1. Interpretation: I interpret human language input and extract the relevant information from my database.

2. Generation: After interpreting the input, I generate coherent and grammatically correct responses using my trained language model parameters.

3. Data Augmentation: To improve my ability to understand context, I incorporate techniques like data augmentation, which alters existing data points while preserving their relationships with other data points.

As a Stable LM model, its primary purpose is to assist human users in retrieving relevant information from various domains using natural language interaction.
