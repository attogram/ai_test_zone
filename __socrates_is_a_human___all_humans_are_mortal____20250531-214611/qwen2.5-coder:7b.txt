Yes, Socrates is mortal. The argument follows the structure of deductive reasoning:

1. Socrates is a human.
2. All humans are mortal.
3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

Since all humans share the property of mortality, and Socrates is classified as a human, it logically follows that Socrates must be mortal.
