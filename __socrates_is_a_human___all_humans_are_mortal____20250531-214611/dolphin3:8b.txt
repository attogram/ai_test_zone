Yes, based on the given premises that all humans are mortal and Socrates is a human, it can be logically concluded that Socrates is mortal. This conclusion follows from a syllogism where the first premise states that all humans are mortal (All A are B), the second premise states that Socrates is human (S is A), and thus the conclusion derived from these premises is that Socrates is mortal (S is B).
