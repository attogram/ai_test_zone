Sure, here's how we can answer the question:

**1. Socrates is a human.**

This is a statement of fact, as Socrates is a known historical figure who was a human being.

**2. All humans are mortal.**

This is also a statement of fact. All living things, including humans, eventually die and cease to exist.

**3. Is Socrates mortal?**

The question asks whether Socrates is mortal. Since Socrates is a human, and humans are mortal, the answer is **yes**. Socrates is therefore mortal.
