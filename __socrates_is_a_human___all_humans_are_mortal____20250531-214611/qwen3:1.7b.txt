Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Socrates is mortal based on the given premises. So the first premise is that Socrates is a human. The second is that all humans are mortal. The question is whether Socrates is mortal.

Hmm, logical reasoning here. So, if all humans are mortal, then any human would be mortal. Since Socrates is a human, then according to the second premise, he should be mortal. That seems straightforward. But maybe I need to check if there are any exceptions or additional premises. The user didn't mention any exceptions, so assuming the premises are all true and there's no exception, then yes, Socrates must be mortal.

Wait, but in real life, Socrates was indeed mortal. He lived and died, so the conclusion holds. But in formal logic, the argument is valid. The structure is: All humans (H) are mortal (M). Socrates (S) is a human. Therefore, S is mortal. That's a valid argument form, modus ponens. So the answer should be yes, Socrates is mortal.

I should make sure there's no trick here. The user might be testing if I can apply the logical rules correctly. Since the premises are given as true, and the conclusion follows logically, the answer is yes. No need to overcomplicate it. Just apply the basic syllogism.

Based on the given premises:  
1. **Socrates is a human.**  
2. **All humans are mortal.**  

The logical structure is a **syllogism** of the form:  
- **All H (humans) are M (mortal).**  
- **Socrates is H.**  
- **Therefore, Socrates is M (mortal).**  

This is a valid form of reasoning (**modus ponens**), and the conclusion directly follows from the premises. Since all humans are mortal and Socrates is a human, it logically follows that **Socrates is mortal**.  

**Answer:** Yes, Socrates is mortal.
