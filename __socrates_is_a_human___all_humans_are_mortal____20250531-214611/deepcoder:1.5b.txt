Okay, so I need to figure out if Socrates is mortal based on the given statements. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the statement says that Socrates is a human. That means Socrates belongs to the category of humans. Now, the second statement says that all humans are mortal. So, since Socrates is a human, and everyone in that group is mortal, it logically follows that Socrates must be mortal. 

I don't see any exceptions or exceptions to these statements, so I think this conclusion holds true.

To determine if Socrates is mortal based on the given statements:

1. **Socrates is a human**: This means Socrates belongs to the category of humans.

2. **All humans are mortal**: This statement implies that every member of the human category has the property of being mortal.

**Conclusion**: Since Socrates is a human and all humans are mortal, it follows logically that Socrates is mortal.

**Answer:** Yes, Socrates is mortal.
