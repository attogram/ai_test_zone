Okay, I need to write a Python function that takes an array and outputs a HTML list of the array contents. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should understand what the user wants. They want a function that converts an array into a HTML list structure. So each element in the array should be wrapped in <element> tags.

I remember that in Python, there's no built-in way to create HTML strings directly, so I'll need to construct it using strings and then convert it into HTML using libraries like BeautifulSoup or create a custom string with appropriate tags.

But wait, perhaps the user just wants a simple list where each item is within <div> tags. That makes sense for simplicity.

So the plan is:

1. Iterate over each element in the array.
2. For each element, wrap it in <div>.
3. Combine all these div elements into a single HTML string with line breaks between them.

How to handle the line breaks? In HTML, line breaks are represented by <br> tags. So each new element in the array will be on a new line.

So the steps in code:

- Take the input array.
- For each item in the array:
   - Create a string like f'<div>{item}</div>'
   - Collect all these strings into a list.
- Join this list with '\n' to create the final HTML string.
- Return the resulting string.

Now, let's think about edge cases. What if the array is empty? Then the function should return an empty string. Also, what if some items contain newlines or other special characters? The current approach will handle them as part of the text within the div, which is acceptable for now.

Let me draft the code:

Define a function called array_to_html that takes arr as argument.

Inside the function:
- Create a list to hold each div string.
- Loop over each item in arr:
   - Append f'<div>{item}</div>' to the list.
- If the list is empty (arr is empty), return an empty string.
- Else, join the list with '\n' and return.

Wait, what if the array has multiple lines? For example, if an item is 'a\nb', it will be displayed as 'a<div>nb</div>' but that's correct because each line inside a div is separate.

Testing this logic with an example:

Array: ['first', 'second']

The function should return '<div>first</div>\n<div>second</div>'

Which when rendered looks like:

first
second

Yes, that works.

Now, let me write the code.

The function would look like this:

def array_to_html(arr):
    if not arr:
        return ''
    html = ['<div>{0}</div>'.format(item) for item in arr]
    return '\n'.join(html)

Testing this with an empty array returns '', which is correct.

What about a single element? It should return '<div>element1</div>\n<div>element2</div>'â€”no, wait, if the array has one element, then the join will create just one string. Wait no: let's see.

If arr is ['a'], then html becomes ['<div>a</div>'], and joining with '\n' gives '<div>a</div>', which when rendered is:

a

Which is correct.

Another test case: arr = [1, 2, 3]. The function returns:

<div>1</div>\n<div>2</div>\n<div>3</div>

Which renders as:

1
2
3

Yes, that's correct.

I think this should handle most cases. Now, let me write the code.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to create a function that converts an array into a HTML list structure. Each element of the array will be wrapped in `<div>` tags, and each element will be on a new line within the resulting HTML string.

### Approach
1. **Input Handling**: The function takes an array as input.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array is empty, the function returns an empty string.
3. **String Construction**: For each element in the array, construct a string that wraps the element in `<div>` tags.
4. **Join Strings**: Combine all these constructed strings into a single HTML string with line breaks between elements using `\n` as the separator.

### Solution Code
```python
def array_to_html(arr):
    if not arr:
        return ''
    html = ['<div>{0}</div>'.format(item) for item in arr]
    return '\n'.join(html)
```

### Explanation
1. **Input Handling**: The function first checks if the input array is empty. If it is, it returns an empty string immediately.
2. **String Construction**: Using a list comprehension, each element from the array is wrapped in `<div>` tags. This creates a list of strings where each string is a `<div>` containing one array element.
3. **Join Strings**: The list of these constructed strings is then joined into a single string with `\n` (newline) as the separator, resulting in an HTML list structure.

This approach ensures that each element from the input array is properly formatted and separated by line breaks, creating a clean HTML representation of the array contents.
