Okay, the user just said "hi". I need to respond appropriately. Since they're greeting me, I should respond with a friendly greeting. Maybe "Hello!" or "Hi there!" to keep it warm. I should also ask how I can assist them to encourage them to share what they need. Let me make sure the tone is welcoming and open. I'll go with "Hello! How can I assist you today?" That sounds good.
