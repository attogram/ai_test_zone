Okay, the user just said "hi" and I need to respond. Let me start by acknowledging their greeting. I should be friendly and open. Maybe say something like, "Hello! How can I assist you today?" That's a good way to greet them. I can add a bit more to make it personal, like asking how I can help them in their day. Keep it simple and positive. No need to add anything else, just a friendly reply.
