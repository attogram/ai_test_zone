Okay, the user just said "hi". I need to respond appropriately. Since they didn't ask a specific question, I should keep it friendly and open-ended. Maybe ask how I can assist them. Let me make sure the response is welcoming and invites them to ask anything they need help with. I should avoid being too formal and keep the tone conversational. Let me check for any possible misunderstandings. No, they just said "hi", so a simple greeting and offer of help should be good.
