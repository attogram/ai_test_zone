Okay, the user said "hi". I need to respond appropriately. Since they didn't provide any specific context, I should keep it friendly and open. Maybe greet them back and offer assistance. Let me make sure it's polite and invites them to ask questions. Avoid any markdown and keep the tone warm.

Hmm, "Hello! How can I assist you today?" That sounds good. It's concise and invites them to share their needs. Yeah, that works. Let me check for any possible misunderstandings. No, it's straightforward. Alright, ready to send.
