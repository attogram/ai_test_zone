In the heart of a futuristic city, under a ceiling illuminated by blue lights, three pink llamas stand in a row. Each llama is adorned with black googles on its head and two arms on either side of its body. The leftmost llama gazes directly at us, while the other two look towards each other as if engaged in a conversation. They are standing on a floor that gives off a blue hue.

The cityscape around them is just as intriguing. In the background, a network of wires and servers fill the scene, hinting at advanced technology. Above this technological landscape, a purple sky stretches out, adding a surreal touch to the scene. The llamas seem to be in harmony with their environment, creating a unique blend of nature and technology.
