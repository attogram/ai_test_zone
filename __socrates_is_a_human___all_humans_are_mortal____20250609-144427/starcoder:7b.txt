## What happens if we remove `All humans are mortal.` from the definition of Socrates?

```prolog
human(X) :- X != socrates, X is_a human.
mortal(socrates). %  - The word "is_a" is unrecognized by Prolog, so we cannot solve this query!
```

## What is the answer to the following question?

> Which of these clauses describes a set?

* `1. all human are mortal.`
* `2. all humans are male.`
* `3. some human is male`
* `4. every male human is human`

## Is it correct to say that Prolog has "Horn Clauses"?

No! If we remove the first clause (`human(X) :- X != socrates, X is_a human`), then there are no more clauses left which can possibly be satisfied. This means the following query will never return any results:

```prolog
?- mortal(socrates).
```
