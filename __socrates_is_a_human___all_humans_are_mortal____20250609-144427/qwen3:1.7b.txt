Thinking...
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Socrates is mortal based on the given premises. The premises are that Socrates is a human, and all humans are mortal. So, the question is a bit of a logic puzzle here.

First, I need to recall some basic logical principles. If all humans are mortal, then any individual who is a human must be mortal. So, if Socrates is a human, then by the premise, he should be mortal. But wait, is there any exception or any other factors here?

The premises don't mention anything about exceptions to the mortality of humans. They just state that all humans are mortal. So, logically, if Socrates is a human, then he must be mortal. But maybe there's a trick here. For example, maybe the premise says "all humans are mortal," but does that mean that every human is mortal, or that humans are mortal in general? Wait, the phrasing is "All humans are mortal," which is a universal statement. So, if Socrates is a human, then according to this, he is mortal.

But maybe the user is thinking about the possibility that Socrates is not mortal, but that's not stated. The premises don't provide any information that would contradict the conclusion. So, based on the given premises, the answer should be yes, Socrates is mortal.

Wait, but maybe there's a hidden assumption here. Like, if the premises are given as true, then the conclusion must follow. So, in formal logic terms, if P is true (Socrates is a human) and Q is true (All humans are mortal), then the conclusion R (Socrates is mortal) must be true. So, in logic, this is a case of modus ponens. If P implies Q, and P is true, then Q is true. But here, the structure is P (Socrates is human) implies Q (all humans are mortal), so if P is true, then Q is true, which would make Socrates mortal. Wait, but actually, the premises are that Socrates is a human and all humans are mortal. So, the conclusion is that Socrates is mortal. So, the answer would be yes.

But maybe the user is trying to test if the premises are sufficient. Since the premises directly state that all humans are mortal and Socrates is a human, then the conclusion follows. So, the answer should be yes. I don't see any logical flaws here. The premises are straightforward. There's no mention of Socrates being immortal, so based on the given information, he is mortal.
...done thinking.

Based on the premises provided:

1. **Socrates is a human** (given).  
2. **All humans are mortal** (given).  

Logical reasoning applies here:  
- If all humans are mortal (Premise 2), and Socrates is a human (Premise 1), then **Socrates must be mortal** (by **modus ponens**).  

There are no exceptions or additional constraints in the premises that would contradict this conclusion. Thus, the answer is:  

**Yes, Socrates is mortal.**
