Thinking...
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Socrates is mortal. The user gave me some information: first that Socrates is a human, second that all humans are mortal, and then they're asking if Socrates is mortal.

Hmm, let's start by breaking down what each part means. So, Socrates being a human means he belongs to the category of humans. Humans, according to the second statement, are a subset of mortal beings because they can cause death. So, since humans are all mortal, and Socrates is one of them, it seems logical that Socrates must be mortal.

Wait, but am I missing something? Are there any exceptions or special cases where humans aren't necessarily mortal? Like, maybe some religious beliefs or mystical views suggest otherwise? But the user didn't mention anything about that. They just gave a general statement that all humans are mortal. So, unless there's more information provided later in the conversation, I should stick to what's given.

Also, Socrates is a well-known figure from classical philosophy. In his dialogue "The Cbread and Oedipus," he is depicted as a noble human who dies at 80 due to an accident. That would support the idea that humans can die, making him mortal. But again, I'm not sure if that's relevant here because it's about how people perceive Socrates rather than his actual mortality.

So, putting it all together: since humans are all mortal and Socrates is a human, logically, he must be mortal. The other possibilities like religious views don't seem to apply unless specified.
...done thinking.

Socrates is mortal because:

1. **Definition of Humans**: Socrates belongs to the category of humans.
2. **General Statement on Mortality**: All humans are mortal beings.

Therefore, as a human, Socrates must be mortal.
