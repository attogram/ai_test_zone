Thinking...
First, the user says: "Socrates is a human." That's given as fact.

Then, "All humans are mortal." This means that being human implies mortality. So, if something is a human, it must be mortal.

Finally, the question: "Is Socrates mortal?"

This seems like a classic syllogism from logic. I need to reason step by step based on these premises.

Premise 1: Socrates is a human. (We can take this as true.)

Premise 2: All humans are mortal. This means that for any person, if they are human, then they are mortal.

Therefore, since Socrates is human and all humans are mortal, Socrates must be mortal.

I should consider if there's any trick here. The user might be testing basic logical reasoning or perhaps pointing to something else in philosophy, like the Socratic paradox or something related to his teachings. But based on what's given, it seems straightforward.

Also, ensure that "mortal" is defined properly. In this context, "mortal" means subject to death, which aligns with the common understanding from the premise.

No other information is provided, so I should stick to these premises.

Response should be clear and logical. Since this is a reasoning exercise, I need to state my conclusion based on deduction.
...done thinking.

Yes, Socrates is mortal.

This follows from the given premises:
- All humans are mortal (meaning no exceptions or special cases).
- Socrates is a human.

Therefore, by deductive reasoning, Socrates must be mortal. This is a simple example of syllogistic logic, where two premises lead to a logical conclusion.
