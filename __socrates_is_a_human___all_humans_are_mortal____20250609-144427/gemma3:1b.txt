This is a classic philosophical thought experiment! Here’s the breakdown:

*   **Socrates is a human.** This is a factual statement.
*   **All humans are mortal.** This is also a factual statement.
*   **Therefore, Socrates is mortal.**

**Yes, Socrates is mortal.**

However, the question is a bit more nuanced. Socrates's famous questioning and emphasis on living a virtuous life suggest he *chose* to pursue knowledge and virtue, not necessarily to live a long life. The statement doesn’t definitively *prove* he is mortal; it simply establishes a connection between being human and mortality.
