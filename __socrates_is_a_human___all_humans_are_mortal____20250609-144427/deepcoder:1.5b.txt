Okay, so I need to figure out whether Socrates is mortal based on the given statements. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the statement says, "Socrates is a human." That means Socrates belongs to the category of humans. Now, the second part says, "All humans are mortal." This is a universal statement that applies to every single human being.

So, if all humans are mortal, and Socrates is one of those humans, then logically, it follows that Socrates must be mortal. It's like a chain of reasoning where each conclusion leads to the next. Since all members of a certain group have a particular trait, any individual in that group will have that trait as well.

I'm pretty confident about this because it's based on logical syllogisms and the way statements are structured. There's no exception or exception case mentioned here, so I don't need to consider any special cases for Socrates.

Based on the given statements:

1. "Socrates is a human."
2. "All humans are mortal."

We can logically deduce that since all humans are mortal and Socrates is a human, it follows that Socrates is mortal.

**Answer:** Yes, Socrates is mortal.
