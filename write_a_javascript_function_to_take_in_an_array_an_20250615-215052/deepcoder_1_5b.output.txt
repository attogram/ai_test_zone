Okay, I need to write a JavaScript function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list of its contents. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should consider how to structure the HTML. An unordered list is probably the way to go since it's simple and common. Each item in the array will be a list item in the HTML.

So, the function will start by creating a <ul> element. Then, for each item in the input array, I'll create a <li> element inside the <ul>. 

I should make sure that each <li> has some content, like the item's value. But wait, what if the items are complex objects or not strings? Hmm, maybe for now, I'll assume each item is a string to keep it simple.

Next, I need to handle cases where an item might be empty or null. Maybe adding a comment about handling such cases would be good, but perhaps that's beyond the current scope.

So, the function will loop through each element of the array. For each element, create a <li> and append it to the list.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this:

- Create a new empty <ul>.
- Loop through each item in the input array.
- For each item, create a new <li> and add it to the list.
- Return the created <ul>.

I should also consider edge cases, like an empty array. If the array is empty, the function will return an empty <ul>, which might not be desired. But perhaps that's acceptable since there are no items to display.

Testing the function with a sample array would help. For example, if the input is [1,2,3], the output should be an unordered list with three li elements containing each number.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.

To solve this problem, we need to create a JavaScript function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list of its contents. Each element from the array will be displayed as a list item within an unordered list.

### Approach
1. **Create an Unordered List**: Use an `<ul>` element to contain all the list items.
2. **Loop Through Array**: Iterate over each element in the input array.
3. **Create List Items**: For each element, create a `<li>` element and add it to the `<ul>`.
4. **Return Result**: Return the created `<ul>` containing the list items.

This approach ensures that each element from the array is displayed as a separate list item within an unordered list structure in HTML.

### Solution Code
```html
function createHtmlFromArray(array) {
    const htmlList = new Array(array).map(item => (
        <li>${item}</li>
    ));
    return htmlList;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Create Unordered List**: The function starts by creating an empty `<ul>` using `new Array(array)`, which creates an array of the same length as the input. Each element is then mapped to a list item.
- **Map Function**: The `.map` method is used to transform each element in the input array into a list item. Each item is wrapped inside a `<li>` tag within the `<ul>`.
- **Return Result**: The function returns the resulting HTML list, which includes all elements from the input array as separate list items.

This solution efficiently converts an array into an HTML list structure, making it easy to display multiple items in a structured format.
