This is a classic, wonderfully silly phrase! It’s a line from the British comedy show *The Mighty Boosh*. 

It’s a nonsensical phrase, often used to express a feeling of chaos or absurdity. 

Do you want to:

*   **Just enjoy the phrase?** (I can tell you more about its origin.)
*   **Try to come up with a follow-up line?** (Let's see what absurd thing we can say next!)
