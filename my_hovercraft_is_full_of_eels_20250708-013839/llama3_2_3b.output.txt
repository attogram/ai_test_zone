It sounds like you're referencing the classic song "My hovercraft is full of eels" by David Bowie. Released in 1969, it was one of his earliest singles and has since become a cult classic.

The song's lyrics are often surreal and open to interpretation, but they seem to describe a sense of excitement and nervousness about an impending event or experience. The image of a hovercraft filled with eels is certainly... unusual!

Do you have a personal connection to this song, or was it just a fun musical reference?
