Your line, *"My hovercraft is full of eels,"* is a playful nod to a classic song by the British comedy band **The Rutles**. It’s a humorous parody of the Beatles' "I Am the Walrus," with "eel" replacing "walrus" in a whimsical, nonsensical way. The song is a lighthearted joke, blending absurdity with a nod to the surrealism of 1960s pop culture. 

The Rutles were known for their satirical take on The Beatles, and this line is one of their most iconic and quirky examples. If you're referencing this, it's a fun and creative way to talk about something unexpected—like a hovercraft full of eels! 🐟🚁
