It seems like you're referring to a classic bit of English humor from the 1950s or maybe an echo of some other context. If your statement is about having many tasks or problems "full of eels" (something chaotic and hard to handle), I can suggest some general advice:

1. Prioritize: Try to identify which tasks are most important and focus on those first.

2. Break it down: Large, overwhelming tasks can often be broken down into smaller, more manageable parts.

3. Delegate: If possible, share the workload with others who might be able to help.

4. Seek support: Reach out to colleagues, friends or professionals if you're feeling overwhelmed.

5. Take breaks: It's important not to burn yourself out by working too much without rest.

If there is something specific that you need assistance with, please let me know!
