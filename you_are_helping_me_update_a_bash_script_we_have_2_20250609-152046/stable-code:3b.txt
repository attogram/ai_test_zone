To read and parse the `show.txt` file, you can use the following bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Read and parse show.txt
while IFS= read -r line; do
  name=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $1}')
  value=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $2}')

  case "$name" in
    "Model")
      if [[ !$value =~ ^[0-9]+([.][0-9]+)?s$ ]]; then
        echo "Invalid value format for '$name':"
        echo "$value"
        exit 1
      fi

      # Save data into bash variables
      model_name="$name"
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Unknown section in show.txt file:"
      echo "$name"
      exit 1
      ;;
  esac
done < show.txt

# Print parsed data
echo -e "\nParsed Data from show.txt:"

echo "Model Section"
echo "Name: $model_name"

```

Make sure to save the above script into a file named `parse_show.sh`. Then, you can run this script using the following command:

```bash
bash parse_show.sh
```

This will read and parse the `stats.txt` and `show.txt` files and store the parsed data in bash variables for further processing or analysis as needed.
