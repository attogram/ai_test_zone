Here is a simple Bash shell function that takes an array as input and outputs an HTML list of its elements:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to convert an array into an HTML list
convert_array_to_html() {
  local arr=("$@")

  # Create the HTML list element
  echo "<ul>"

  # Loop through each element in the array and output it as a list item
  for i in "${!arr[@]}"; do
    echo "<li>$arr[$i]</li>"
  done

  # Close the HTML list element
  echo "</ul>"
}

# Example usage:
my_array=(item1 "value1" item2 "value2" item3 "value3")
echo "$convert_array_to_html $my_array"
```
This function takes an array as input, loops through each element in the array, and outputs it as a list item with its value. The resulting HTML list is then output to the console.

Note that this function assumes that the array elements are strings. If your array contains other types of values (e.g., numbers or special characters), you may need to modify the function accordingly.
