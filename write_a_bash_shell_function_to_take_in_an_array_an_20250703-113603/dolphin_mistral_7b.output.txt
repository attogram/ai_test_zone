Sure! Here's a simple bash shell function that takes in an array as input and outputs an HTML unordered list (`<ul>`) with each item in the array:

```bash
list_array() {
    local ARRAY=$1
    echo "<ul>"
    for item in "${ARRAY[@]}"; do
        echo "<li>$item</li>"
    done
    echo "</ul>"
}
```

You can use this function by passing your array as an argument. For example, if you have an array called `my_array`, you would call the function like this:

```bash
list_array my_array
```

The output will be an HTML unordered list with each item in your array.
