To create a Bash shell function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list of its elements, we can define a function that processes the array elements and constructs a `<ul>` list with `<li>` elements for each element in the array.

---

### âœ… Function Definition

```bash
array_to_html() {
    local arr=("$@")
    echo "<ul>"
    for element in "${arr[@]}"; do
        echo "  <li>$element</li>"
    done
    echo "</ul>"
}
```

---

### ðŸ“Œ Explanation

- **Function Name:** `array_to_html`
- **Parameters:** Accepts the array elements as individual arguments.
- **Processing:**
  - The function captures all passed arguments into an array `arr` using `local arr=("$@")`.
  - A `<ul>` tag is output to start the list.
  - Each element of the array is processed in a `for` loop, and a `<li>` tag is generated for each element.
  - The loop ends with a closing `</ul>` tag to complete the list.

### ðŸ§ª Example Usage

```bash
array_to_html apple banana cherry
```

Output:
```html
<ul>
  <li>apple</li>
  <li>banana</li>
  <li>cherry</li>
</ul>
```

### ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The function assumes that the array is passed as individual arguments.
- It does not handle empty arrays or special cases like `null` values.
- The list is rendered with indentation (`  `) for readability.
- The function is simple and straightforward for basic use cases.

This function provides a clean and efficient way to convert an array into an HTML list in Bash.
