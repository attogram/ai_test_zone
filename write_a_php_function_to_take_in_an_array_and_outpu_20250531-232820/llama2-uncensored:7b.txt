Sure, here is a PHP function that takes in an array as input and outputs a HTML list of the array contents:
```php
function makeList($array) {
 echo "<ol";
 foreach ($array as $item) {
 echo " <li>$item";
 }
 echo "</ol>";
}
```
This function first initializes an empty string to store the output. It then uses a `foreach` loop to iterate over each item in the array. Inside the loop, it checks if the current item is not equal to `` (empty string) and then outputs it as a list item with a space before and after it. Finally, the function ends the HTML list using an `echo` statement.
