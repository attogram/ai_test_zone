"My Hovercraft is Full of Eels" is a song by The National from their 2007 album *The Long Day Closes*. It’s a melancholic, introspective track that uses the line as a metaphor for emotional turmoil, loneliness, or a sense of being overwhelmed. The phrase itself is intentionally quirky—mixing the mechanical (hovercraft) with the organic (eels), creating a surreal, almost absurd image. 

If you're referencing the song, it might be a nod to the album's themes of isolation and existential reflection. But if you're using it as a playful or creative line, it could also be a way to evoke a sense of whimsy or unexpected juxtaposition. 

Would you like to explore the song's meaning, the lyrics, or maybe even brainstorm a creative story or joke based on the line? 🐟🚁
