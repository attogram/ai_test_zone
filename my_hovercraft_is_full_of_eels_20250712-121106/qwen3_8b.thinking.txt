Okay, the user said, "My hovercraft is full of eels." That's a classic line from the Monty Python and the Holy Grail movie. I should start by acknowledging that reference. Let me make sure I'm remembering the context correctly. In the movie, the knight says this line when he's trying to convince the king that he's the right person to take the Holy Grail. The line is funny because it's absurd and unexpected.

Now, the user might be referencing that line, so I should mention the movie and the context. But maybe they're also using it as a starting point for a conversation. I should check if they want to continue the joke, discuss the movie, or if they have a different intention. Since the user hasn't provided more context, I should offer a friendly response that acknowledges the reference and opens the door for further conversation. Maybe ask if they want to talk about the movie or if they have something else in mind. Keeping the tone light and humorous would be appropriate here.
