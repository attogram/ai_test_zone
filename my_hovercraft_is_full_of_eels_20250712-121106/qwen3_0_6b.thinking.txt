Okay, the user mentioned their hovercraft is full of eels. I need to respond appropriately. First, I should acknowledge their situation and express concern. Eels are dangerous, so I should emphasize safety first. Maybe suggest they take precautions, like avoiding the area. Also, ask if they need help or if they want to find a safe place to hide. Make sure the response is friendly and supportive, keeping the tone positive despite the situation.
