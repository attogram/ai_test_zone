Okay, the user just said "hi". I need to respond appropriately. Since they're greeting me, I should respond in a friendly and welcoming manner. I should make sure to acknowledge their greeting and perhaps ask how I can assist them. I should keep it simple and not overcomplicate things. Let me check if there's any specific context I need to consider, but since they just said "hi", there's no additional information. So, a standard friendly response should work. Maybe something like, "Hello! How can I assist you today?" That's concise and opens the door for them to ask anything they need help with. I should make sure the tone is positive and helpful. Alright, that should do it.
