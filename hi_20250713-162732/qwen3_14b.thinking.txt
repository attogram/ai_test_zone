Okay, the user said "hi". I need to respond appropriately. Since it's a greeting, I should greet them back and offer help. Maybe say something like "Hello! How can I assist you today?" That's friendly and opens the door for them to ask questions. I should keep it simple and positive. Let me check if there's any other context I need to consider. No, just a straightforward greeting. Alright, that should work.
