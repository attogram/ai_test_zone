Thinking...
First, the user gives two premises:

1. "Socrates is a human."

2. "All humans are mortal."

Then they ask: "Is Socrates mortal?"

This is a classic syllogism from logic. It's based on deductive reasoning.

The logical structure is:

- All humans are mortal (this is a universal affirmative).

- Socrates is a human (this is a particular affirmative, or an instance of the universal set).

Therefore, Socrates must be mortal because he belongs to the category that all members have this property.

I need to reason step by step and box my final answer.

Since I'm an AI, I should respond clearly and logically. Maybe start with restating the premises to show understanding.

Then apply the syllogism: If A is B, and all Bs are C, then A must be C.

Here:

- Let H represent "human"

- Let M represent "mortal"

Premise 1: Socrates ∈ H

Premise 2: For all x, if x ∈ H then x ∈ M

Therefore, Socrates ∈ M

So, the answer should be yes, Socrates is mortal.

The user might be testing basic reasoning or perhaps this is part of a larger context. But based on what's given, it's straightforward.

I should consider if there's any trick here. For example, are humans defined as mortal in all contexts? Or could "all humans" exclude some?

But the premises state that all humans are mortal, and Socrates is human, so no exclusion mentioned.

Also, this might be referencing Plato or the famous story about Socrates being mortal.

In philosophy, there's often debate about definitions, but for a simple logic question like this, I should stick to the given information.

My response: State that based on the premises, Socrates must be mortal. Then confirm with "Yes."

But to make it engaging, perhaps explain briefly why.
...done thinking.

Based on the given premises:

- **Premise 1:** Socrates is a human.
- **Premise 2:** All humans are mortal.

This forms a logical syllogism where the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. Since Socrates belongs to the category of humans and all humans share the property of being mortal, it must be true that Socrates is mortal.

Therefore, yes, Socrates is mortal.
