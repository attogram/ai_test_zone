Yes, based on the first two premises, we can conclude that since all humans are mortal and Socrates is a human, then it follows that Socrates must also be mortal. Therefore, Socrates' mortality is confirmed by these premises.

Alternatively, if you were asking whether or not there exists another premise that states "Socrates isn't mortal," the answer would depend on what other relevant information about Socrates was known beyond those three statements in this scenario.
However, based solely on those three statements provided here, we can conclude from deductive logic principles (modus ponens) that since all humans are mortal and Socrates is a human, it logically follows that he must be mortal as well.
