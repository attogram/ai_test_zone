Socrates, being a human, could potentially be mortal if proven to be deceased or having an abnormal lifespan.

However, the statement "All humans are mortal" by itself does not necessarily imply that Socrates (or any other human) is mortal. 

To conclusively determine whether Socrates is mortal, further scientific evidence or theories would need to be established.

As of now, no conclusive evidence suggests that Socrates is mortal.
