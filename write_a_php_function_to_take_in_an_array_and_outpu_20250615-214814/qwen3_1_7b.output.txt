Thinking...
Okay, I need to write a PHP function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list of its contents. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function should accept an array as input. So maybe the function is called something like generateHtmlList or similar. The parameters would be the array. Then, I need to loop through each element of the array and create list items.

In PHP, to create a list, I can use the <ul> tag with <li> for each item. So, for each element in the array, I'll add a <li> tag containing the element's value. Then wrap all those in a <ul> tag.

Wait, but what if the array is empty? Well, the function should handle that. If the array is empty, it should output an empty ul, which is okay.

So the steps are:

1. Define the function with a parameter, say $array.
2. Check if the array is not empty. Maybe just loop through it regardless.
3. Initialize a variable to hold the HTML output, maybe $html.
4. Loop through each element in the array using a foreach loop.
5. For each element, add the corresponding <li> tag to $html.
6. After the loop, wrap the entire HTML in a <ul> tag and output it.

Wait, but how to handle the loop? Let's think. In PHP, a foreach loop would be something like:

foreach ($array as $value) {
    $html .= '<li>' . $value . '</li>';
}

Then, wrap that in a <ul> tag.

So putting it all together, the function would look like:

function generateHtmlList($array) {
    $html = '<ul>';
    foreach ($array as $value) {
        $html .= '<li>' . $value . '</li>';
    }
    $html .= '</ul>';
    return $html;
}

But wait, what if the array has nested arrays? The problem statement says "take in an array", so maybe the function should handle nested arrays? The question doesn't specify, so perhaps the function is intended for simple arrays. But the user didn't mention handling nested arrays, so maybe just assume the input is a simple array.

So the function as written should work. Let me test with a sample array. For example, if the input is ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], the output would be <ul><li>apple</li><li>banana</li><li>cherry</li></ul>.

But what if the array is empty? Then $html would be '<ul></ul>', which is correct.

So the function seems to handle all cases. The user just wants the function to output the HTML list. So this should be the solution.
...done thinking.

To create a PHP function that takes an array and generates an HTML list of its contents, we can define a simple and robust function that handles both empty and non-empty arrays.

### ‚úÖ Function Overview

- **Function Name**: `generateHtmlList`
- **Parameter**: `$array` (an array of elements to be listed)
- **Return Value**: A string containing the HTML list (e.g., `<ul><li>...</li></ul>`)

---

### üß™ Example Usage

```php
$fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
echo generateHtmlList($fruits);
```

**Output**:
```html
<ul><li>apple</li><li>banana</li><li>cherry</li></ul>
```

---

### üß© Implementation

```php
function generateHtmlList($array) {
    $html = '<ul>';

    // Loop through each element in the array
    foreach ($array as $value) {
        $html .= '<li>' . htmlspecialchars($value) . '</li>';
    }

    $html .= '</ul>';

    return $html;
}
```

### üìå Notes

- **Security**: The `htmlspecialchars()` function is used to prevent XSS vulnerabilities by escaping any HTML characters in the array elements.
- **Empty Array**: If the input array is empty, the function returns `"<ul></ul>"`, which is valid HTML.
- **Nested Arrays**: This function assumes the input is a flat array. If you need to handle nested arrays, additional logic would be required.

---

### üìù Summary

This function is simple, efficient, and handles all typical cases for an array-to-HTML-list conversion. It's a clean and readable way to generate list elements in PHP.
