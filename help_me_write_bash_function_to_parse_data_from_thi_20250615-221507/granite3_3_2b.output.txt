Here are bash functions that should meet your requirements:

```bash
function parse_model_info() {
  local model_info_file="model.info.txt"
  local current_section=""

  while IFS= read -r line; do
    case "$line" in
      "^Model$"*)
        current_section="Model"
        continue
        ;;
      "^Capabilities$"*)
        current_section="Capabilities"
        declare -A capabilities_array
        while IFS=":" read -r key value <<<$line; do
          capabilities_array[$key]=$value
        done <<< "$line"
        ;;
      "^System$"*)
        current_section="System"
        system_prompt=$(cat <<<'EOF'
$line
EOF
        ;;
      "^Parameters$"*)
        current_section="Parameters"
        while IFS=':' read -r key value; do
          if [[ "$key" == "temperature" ]]; then
            temperature=$value
          fi
        done <<< "$line"
        ;;
      *)
        case "$current_section" in
          Model|Capabilities|System|Parameters)
            echo "Skipping line: $line" >> /dev/stderr
          ;;
        esac
        ;;
    esac
  done < "$model_info_file"
}

function main() {
  parse_model_info
}

main
```

This script reads the `model.info.txt` file line by line and processes each line based on its section header:

1. If the line matches "Model", it stores the value in a variable named after the key (e.g., `architecture="granite"` becomes `name="granite"`, but currently, there's no assignment due to missing `$value`).
2. If the line matches "Capabilities", it declares an array named `capabilities_array` and parses each keyword-value pair, storing them in the array.
3. If the line matches "System", it captures the lines following until the next section header as the system prompt.
4. If the line matches "Parameters", it extracts only the 'temperature' value.
5. For any other line or missing sections/lines, it skips them and outputs an error message.

You can call `main()` to execute the function. After parsing, you'll have the respective variables and arrays containing the data from your file.
