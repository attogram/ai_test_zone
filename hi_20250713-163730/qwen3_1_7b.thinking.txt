Okay, the user said "hi". I need to respond appropriately. Since they didn't provide any specific query, I should keep it simple and friendly. Maybe acknowledge their greeting and offer assistance. Let me make sure to use a welcoming tone and ask if they need help with anything. Keep it concise but helpful.
