Okay, the user said "hi". I need to respond appropriately. Let me check the guidelines. The response should be friendly and open-ended. Maybe ask how I can assist them. Keep it simple and welcoming. Avoid any technical jargon. Make sure to use proper grammar and punctuation. Alright, something like "Hello! How can I assist you today?" That should work.
