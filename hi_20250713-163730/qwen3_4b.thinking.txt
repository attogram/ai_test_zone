Okay, the user sent "hi". I need to respond appropriately. Since they just said "hi", a friendly greeting is needed. Maybe start with a simple "Hello!" or "Hi there!" to acknowledge them. Then, ask how I can assist them. Keep it open-ended so they can tell me what they need help with. Make sure the tone is warm and inviting. Let me check if there's any specific context I should consider, but since there's no prior conversation, a general response should be fine. Alright, I'll go with "Hello! How can I assist you today?" That sounds good.
