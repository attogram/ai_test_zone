Thinking...
First, I need to identify the letter 'r' in the word "Strawberry."

The spelling of "Strawberry" is S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y.

Looking through each character one by one: S, T, R, A, W, B, E, R, R, Y. I see an 'R' at position 3 and another 'R' later in the word at positions 8 and 9. Therefore, there are two 'r's in the word.
...done thinking.

To determine how many **r**s are in the word "Strawberry," let's break it down step by step.

1. **Write out the word:**  
   **Strawberry**

2. **Identify each letter and its position:**
   - **S**  
   - **T**  
   - **R**  
   - **A**  
   - **W**  
   - **B**  
   - **E**  
   - **R**  
   - **R**  
   - **Y**

3. **Locate the 'r's:**
   - The letter **R** appears at position 3.
   - Another **R** is found at positions 8 and 9.

4. **Count the occurrences:**  
   There are two instances of the letter **R** in the word "Strawberry."

\boxed{2}
