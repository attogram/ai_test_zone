Okay, the user said "hi" and I need to respond. Let me start by greeting them. "Hi there!" is a good opener. Then, I can ask a question to engage them, like "How can I assist you today?" That keeps the conversation going. I should keep the tone friendly and open-ended. Maybe add a smiley to make it more personal. Wait, the user might be testing me, so I should be ready to ask questions in case they have a specific topic. Let me make sure the response is friendly and welcoming, and check if there's anything else they need help with.
