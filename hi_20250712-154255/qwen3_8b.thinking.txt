Okay, the user sent "hi" and I need to respond appropriately. Let me start by acknowledging their greeting. I should make sure to keep the tone friendly and welcoming. Since they might be testing the waters or just starting a conversation, I should invite them to ask questions or share what they need help with. I'll keep it simple and open-ended to encourage further interaction. Let me check if there's anything else I need to consider, like cultural nuances or potential follow-up questions. No, I think that's covered. Alright, time to put it all together.
