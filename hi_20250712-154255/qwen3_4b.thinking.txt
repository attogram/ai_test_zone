Okay, the user just said "hi". That's a greeting. I need to respond politely. Let me think of a friendly reply. Maybe "Hello! How can I assist you today?" That sounds good. It's welcoming and opens the door for them to ask questions. I should keep it simple and positive. No need for any complex phrases. Just a straightforward response. Alright, that's all I need.
