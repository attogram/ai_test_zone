Okay, the user said "hi". I should respond politely. Maybe greet them back and offer help. Keep it friendly and open-ended. Let them know I'm here to assist. Don't rush them. Maybe add an emoji to keep it warm. Check for any possible follow-up questions they might have. Make sure the response is concise but welcoming.
