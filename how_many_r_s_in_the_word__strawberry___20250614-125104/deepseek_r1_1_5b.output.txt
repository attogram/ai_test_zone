Thinking...
First, I need to identify all the letters in the word "Strawberry" and list them out.

The word "Strawberry" consists of the letters S, T, R, A, W, F, E, B, R, E.

Next, I'll count how many times the letter 'r' appears in this list.

Upon reviewing each letter, I notice that 'R' appears twice: once at the third position and again later on.
...done thinking.

To determine how many ****\( r \)'\( s \)**s are in the word "Strawberry," follow these easy steps:

1. **List the Letters:**
   
   Let's write down each letter in the word "Strawberry":

   \[
   S, T, R, A, W, F, E, B, R, E
   \]

2. **Count the \( r \)â€™s:**

   Now, go through each letter and count how many times the letter 'r' appears.

   - First letter: **S** (not an \( r \))
   - Second letter: **T** (not an \( r \))
   - Third letter: **R** (this is one \( r \))
   - Fourth letter: **A** (not an \( r \))
   - Fifth letter: **W** (not an \( r \))
   - Sixth letter: **F** (not an \( r \))
   - Seventh letter: **E** (not an \( r \))
   - Eighth letter: **B** (not an \( r \))
   - Ninth letter: **R** (this is the second \( r \))
   - Tenth letter: **E** (not an \( r \))

3. **Final Count:**

   From the above, we see that there are two 'r's in the word "Strawberry."

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
