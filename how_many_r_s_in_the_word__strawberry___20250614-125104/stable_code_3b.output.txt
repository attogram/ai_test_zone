The Python string literal "Strawberry" doesn't contain any 'r' characters.Searching for specific character in a string is quite simple with Python. Here's how you can do it:
```python
word = "Strawberry"
count = word.count('r')
print(count)
```
This script will output the number of times 'r' appears in the string "Strawberry". The `count()` method is a built-in function of Python that counts how many times a specified value appears in a sequence (string, list, tuple etc.).
