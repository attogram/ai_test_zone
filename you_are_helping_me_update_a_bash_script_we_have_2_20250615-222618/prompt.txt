You are helping me update a bash script.
We have 2 text files: stats.txt and show.txt.

Read in and parse the stats file:
  - save the data into bash variables
  - each line is in format "name: value"
  - for example line:
    total duration:       4.687657458s
 - is parsed so we can get the name "total duration" and the value "4.687657458s"
 - Example stats.txt file:
'''
total duration:       4.687657458s
load duration:        1.174041625s
prompt eval count:    22 token(s)
prompt eval duration: 152.612625ms
prompt eval rate:     144.16 tokens/s
eval count:           209 token(s)
eval duration:        3.360331625s
eval rate:            62.20 tokens/s

'''

Read in a parse the show.txt file:
  - save the data into bash variables
  - There are 3 sections: Model, Capabilities, and Parameters
  - For Model Section, it's in format "name   value"
  - For Capabilities section, it's a list of 1 or more words
  - For Parameters section, it's in format "name   value"
  - Example show.txt file:
'''
  Model
    architecture        starcoder
    parameters          7.5B
    context length      8192
    embedding length    4096
    quantization        Q4_0

  Capabilities
    completion

  Parameters
    stop    "<|endoftext|>"
