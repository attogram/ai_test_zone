Here is a simple PHP function that takes an array as input and outputs it as an HTML unordered list:

```php
function arrayToHtmlList($array) {
    $html = "<ul>\n";
    foreach ($array as $value) {
        $html .= "  <li>$value</li>\n";
    }
    $html .= "</ul>";
    return $html;
}

$array = array("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry");
print(arrayToHtmlList($array));
```

In this code:

1. `arrayToHtmlList` is the function that takes an input array.
2. The foreach loop iterates through each item in the input array.
3. Each item of the array becomes a list item and is placed into `$html`.
4. After all items are added, the closing unordered list tag is appended to `$html`, so it's now complete HTML code.
5. We use `print` to output the final result.
