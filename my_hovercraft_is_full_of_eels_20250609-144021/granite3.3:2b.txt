This phrase is often used to suggest that someone's statement or situation is absurd or nonsensical. It's a humorous twist on the traditional idiom "full as a balloon" and doesn't require a literal interpretation of having a hovercraft filled with eels. It's a form of paradox or antithmetic, used to question the sanity or validity of an argument or statement.
