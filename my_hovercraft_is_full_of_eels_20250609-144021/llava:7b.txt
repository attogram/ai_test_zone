 This phrase has its origins in the 1962 novel "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams. In the book, a character named Ford Prefect is asked what his job is and he responds with "I work for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," which is actually a fictional guidebook that provides humorous and often absurd information about various topics. The phrase "my hovercraft is full of eels" is one of many made-up facts and statements in the book, meant to be amusing rather than informative.
