My hovercraft is full of eels.this is a sentence containing a contradiction, as the presence of the word "eels" contradicts the description of "hovercraft". This type of error occurs when the meaning of a word used in a sentence does not match the context of the sentence. In this case, the use of the word "eels" may be a typo or could imply another word that is not present in the sentence.
