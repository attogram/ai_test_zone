**4.  Things That Can Help – These are general suggestions, but please talk to a professional:**

*   **Talk to Someone You Trust:**  A friend, family member, teacher, counselor, or anyone you feel comfortable with. Just talking about what you're going through can be a huge relief.
*   **Self-Care:**  Even small things can make a difference.  Try to eat regular meals, get some sleep, exercise, and do something you enjoy – even if it's just for a few minutes.
*   **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them.
*   **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:**  Deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga can calm your mind.
