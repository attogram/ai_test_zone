It seems like you have a unique situation on your hands. If by some chance your hovercraft has been invaded by eels, I would recommend the following steps:

1. Do not attempt to handle the eels yourself as they can be slippery and dangerous.
2. Contact animal control or a professional wildlife removal service immediately.
3. Stay calm and maintain a safe distance from the eels until help arrives.

Remember, it's important to prioritize your safety and the well-being of the animals involved.
