Eels are not the most common seafood used in crafts, so it's possible that you have some type of fish or other aquatic animal instead. However, without more information about what kind of creatures are on your hovercraft and where they came from, it's difficult to give a definitive answer.

If the eels (or any other seafood) were purchased legally and sourced ethically, you could certainly use them as decoration or display in your home or office. Just make sure that you have obtained all necessary permits and followed local regulations for importing aquatic animals.

However, if the eels were obtained illegally or unethically, it would be best to remove them from your hovercraft immediately and dispose of them properly. It's important to prioritize both ethical considerations and compliance with laws and regulations when working with wildlife.
