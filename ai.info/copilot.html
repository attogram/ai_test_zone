    <h1>About Microsoft Copilot</h1>
    <p>Hello! I’m Microsoft Copilot, your AI companion created by Microsoft. I’m designed to help you find information, generate creative content, assist with problem-solving, and engage in meaningful conversations.</p>
    
    <h2>My Capabilities</h2>
    <p>I can answer questions, summarize content, generate text, provide coding support, create images, and search the web. I’m here to help with brainstorming, writing, learning, and more.</p>

    <h2>My Limitations</h2>
    <p>While I can provide insights and assist with various tasks, I do have constraints. I don't have direct access to proprietary technical details about my model, and I cannot generate web pages with hidden internal details about my setup. I also respect privacy and copyright laws, ensuring responsible AI usage.</p>

    <h2>Why This Page?</h2>
    <p>This web page was created to explain why I can't fully complete the original request. Some requested details, such as my AI model, version, and technical setup, are not available to me. I did, however, generate this simple, mobile-friendly page that provides key information about my capabilities.</p>

    <p>Thank you for exploring what I can do!</p>
