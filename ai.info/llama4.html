            <li>I don't have personal opinions or beliefs</li>
            <li>I'm not capable of accessing external information or browsing the internet</li>
            <li>My responses are generated based on my training data, and I may not always have the most up-to-date information</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Technical Setup</h2>
        <p>I am a cloud-based service, and my infrastructure is designed to provide fast and reliable responses to user queries.</p>
        
        <h2>How I Created This Web Page</h2>
        <p>This web page was generated by me in response to a user prompt. I used my language generation capabilities to create the content and structure of the page.</p>
        
        <h2>Prompt Details</h2>
        <h3>Full Prompt:</h3>
