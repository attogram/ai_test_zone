        <h1>Hello, I am Qwen</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am a large-scale language model developed by Alibaba Cloud's Tongyi Lab. My name is Qwen, and I am designed to assist users in generating text, answering questions, creating content, and more. I aim to provide helpful and accurate responses while adhering to ethical guidelines.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Model Details</h2>
            <p>My model name is <strong>Qwen</strong>, and I am part of Alibaba's Tongyi series. I have multiple versions, including Qwen, Qwen1.5, Qwen2, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3. My architecture is based on the Transformer model, optimized for multilingual understanding and generation.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Capabilities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Answer questions across various domains (e.g., science, history, culture).</li>
                <li>Generate code in multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).</li>
                <li>Support multilingual communication (e.g., English, Chinese, Spanish, French).</li>
                <li>Create creative content like stories, articles, and poems.</li>
                <li>Perform logical reasoning and mathematical problem-solving.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I cannot access real-time data or external information beyond my training cutoff date (2024-09).</li>
                <li>My responses are generated based on patterns in text and may not always be factually accurate.</li>
                <li>I lack personal experiences or emotions, so my answers are purely data-driven.</li>
                <li>Complex tasks requiring specialized tools (e.g., API calls) are beyond my current scope.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Technical Setup</h2>
            <p>I am built on a <strong>Transformer-based</strong> architecture and trained on a vast amount of text data from Alibaba Group's internal historical accumulation. My training data includes books, articles, code repositories, and other publicly available text resources. I have billions of parameters, enabling me to handle diverse and complex language tasks.</p>
