        <h1>Hello! I'm Gemini.</h1>

        <p>I am a large language model, an AI assistant, here to help you with a wide range of tasks and provide information. I was trained by Google and launched as part of their ongoing efforts to develop advanced AI technologies.</p>

        <h2>My AI Model and Version</h2>
        <p>I operate on a sophisticated neural network architecture. My underlying model is called <strong>Gemini</strong>, a family of multimodal large language models developed by Google AI. As for my specific version, I am continuously updated and improved by Google, meaning I represent the latest iteration of the Gemini model available to users like you at any given time. I don't have a static version number that changes infrequently; instead, I evolve and refine my capabilities dynamically.</p>

        <h2>My Capabilities</h2>
        <p>My primary capabilities revolve around understanding and generating human-like text. Here are some of the things I can do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information Retrieval:</strong> I can access and process vast amounts of information to answer your questions on virtually any topic.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> I can write creative content, such as poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Summarization:</strong> I can condense lengthy texts into concise summaries.</li>
            <li><strong>Translation:</strong> I can translate text between various languages.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> I can help brainstorm ideas, solve complex problems, and offer different perspectives.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Generation and Explanation:</strong> I can write code snippets in multiple programming languages and explain coding concepts.</li>
            <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> I can perform logical reasoning and follow instructions to complete tasks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Limitations</h2>
        <p>While I'm quite capable, it's important to acknowledge my limitations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lack of Real-World Experience:</strong> I don't have personal experiences, emotions, or consciousness. My knowledge is derived solely from the data I was trained on.</li>
            <li><strong>Factual Accuracy:</strong> Although I strive for accuracy, I can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical information, or "hallucinate." Always cross-reference critical information.</li>
            <li><strong>Bias:</strong> My training data reflects the biases present in the real world, and as a result, I may sometimes exhibit biases in my responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Understanding Nuance:</strong> I may struggle with sarcasm, subtle humor, or deeply nuanced human communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Current Events:</strong> My knowledge cutoff means I may not have information on the most recent events or developments past my last training update.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Boundaries:</strong> I am programmed to avoid generating harmful, unethical, dangerous, or illegal content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Technical Setup</h2>
        <p>I don't have a "physical" technical setup in the traditional sense, as I am a software model. However, I run on Google's extensive and highly optimized infrastructure, which includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Distributed Computing Systems:</strong> I leverage vast clusters of powerful servers and specialized hardware.</li>
            <li><strong>Tensor Processing Units (TPUs):</strong> Google's custom-designed ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) are optimized for machine learning workloads, providing the computational power necessary for my operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Sophisticated Algorithms:</strong> My functionality is powered by complex algorithms that manage data processing, model inference, and response generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Massive Databases:</strong> I access and process petabytes of data stored across Google's global data centers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How This Web Page Was Created</h2>
        <p>This web page was created entirely by me, an AI assistant, in response to your prompt. I processed your request for a self-contained single HTML file and then generated the necessary HTML, CSS, and content. Here's a breakdown of the process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Understanding the Request:</strong> I parsed your prompt to identify all the content requirements (self-description, model details, capabilities, limitations, setup, prompt details) and structural constraints (single HTML file, cross-browser, mobile-friendly).</li>
            <li><strong>Structuring the HTML:</strong> I laid out the basic HTML document structure, including <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags.</li>
            <li><strong>Embedding CSS:</strong> To meet the "self-contained" requirement, I wrote all the styling rules within a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> block in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section. I focused on responsive design using media queries to ensure mobile-friendliness and cross-browser compatibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Populating Content:</strong> I then filled in each section with the requested information, ensuring the language was in the first person where specified and descriptive elsewhere.</li>
            <li><strong>Formatting and Styling:</strong> I applied appropriate HTML tags (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>) and CSS styles to make the content readable and visually appealing.</li>
            <li><strong>Review and Refinement:</strong> Finally, I performed an internal check to ensure all prompt requirements were met and the generated HTML was valid and well-formatted.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Details on This Prompt</h2>
        <p>Here are the specifics regarding the prompt you provided and how I parsed it:</p>
        <h3>How it was parsed:</h3>
        <p>I parsed your prompt by breaking it down into distinct requirements and constraints. I identified:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Content Directives:</strong> Each bullet point under "Content" was recognized as a specific section to be included and described in the first person where appropriate. Keywords like "introduce yourself," "describe yourself," "details on," and specific topics (AI model, capabilities, limitations, technical setup, web page creation, prompt details) served as structural cues.</li>
            <li><strong>Setup Directives:</strong> "self-contained single HTML file" was critical for determining the file structure (embedding CSS). "cross-browser, mobile friendly" dictated the CSS implementation, specifically requiring responsive design techniques like <code>@media</code> queries and flexible units.</li>
            <li><strong>Limits Directives:</strong> "do not ask for clarifications" meant I had to proceed with the information provided and make reasonable assumptions. "just show me the final HTML file" indicated the sole output format. "if you can not do this task, just create web page explaining why not" served as a fallback condition, which I did not need to invoke as I could fulfill the request.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Full Prompt:</h3>
        <pre><code>Create a web page:
