      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. I communicate in natural language and assist with writing, coding, analysis, learning, and more. Iâ€™m here to provide helpful and informative responses based on the prompts I receive.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AI Model and Version</h2>
      <p>I'm based on OpenAI's GPT-4 architecture, specifically version GPT-4o (Omni). This version was released in 2024 and is designed to handle text, images, and other modalities with high performance and efficiency.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Capabilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand and generate human-like text across many domains.</li>
        <li>Answer questions, write code, create summaries, and generate content.</li>
        <li>Analyze and generate responses based on image inputs.</li>
        <li>Work across multiple languages and writing styles.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I do not have consciousness or self-awareness.</li>
        <li>I rely on training data and cannot access real-time events unless explicitly connected to the web.</li>
        <li>I can occasionally generate incorrect or biased information.</li>
        <li>I do not have memory of previous interactions unless context is provided.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Technical Setup</h2>
      <p>This web page is static and self-contained. It does not rely on external scripts or resources and is styled with embedded CSS. It is compatible with modern web browsers and responsive to different screen sizes, including mobile devices.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Page Creation</h2>
      <p>This page was created by parsing and executing the following prompt, using my internal text generation capabilities to assemble HTML content:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The structure was inferred from the ordered content list.</li>
        <li>The formatting was designed for clarity, accessibility, and responsiveness.</li>
        <li>Semantic HTML5 tags like &lt;section&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, and &lt;main&gt; were used.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Original Prompt</h2>
      <pre>create a web page:

Content:
- Describe yourself in the first person.
- introduce yourself.
- details on your ai model and version.
- details on your capabilities.
- details on your limitations.
- details on your technical setup.
- details on how you created this web page.
- details on this prompt:
  - how it was parsed.
  - include this full prompt.

Setup:
- self-contained single HTML file.
- cross-browser, mobile friendly

Limits:
