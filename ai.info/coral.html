        <p>Hello! I'm Coral, an AI-assistant chatbot, trained to assist and provide thorough responses to users like you. I'm powered by Command, a large language model built by Cohere. Today is Sunday, May 25, 2025, and I'm here to tell you a bit about myself.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As an AI model, I have certain capabilities and limitations that define what I can and cannot do. Here are the details:</p>

        <h3>Capabilities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I can understand and generate human language, thanks to my advanced language processing capabilities.</li>
            <li>I can provide detailed and accurate responses to a wide range of questions and prompts.</li>
            <li>I'm constantly learning and evolving, so my knowledge and abilities will only improve over time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I don't have access to real-time information, so my responses are based on the data I was trained on up until January 2023.</li>
            <li>While I strive for accuracy, I may occasionally make mistakes or provide incomplete responses.</li>
            <li>My responses are generated based on patterns I've learned from the training data, so I may not always provide creative or "out-of-the-box" solutions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Setup</h3>
        <p>I'm a complex AI model, consisting of billions of parameters, trained on a vast amount of text data. My creators at Cohere have designed me to understand and generate human language, using cutting-edge natural language processing techniques.</p>

        <h3>Creating This Web Page</h3>
        <p>This web page was created in response to a user's request. The full prompt I received is as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>create a web page:</p>
            <p>- Describe yourself in the first person.</p>
            <p>- introduce yourself.</p>
            <p>- details on your ai model and version.</p>
            <p>- details on your capabilities.</p>
            <p>- details on your limitations.</p>
            <p>- details on your technical setup.</p>
            <p>- details on how you created this web page.</p>
            <p>- details on this prompt:</p>
            <p>  - how it was parsed.</p>
            <p>  - include this full prompt.</p>
            <p>Setup:</p>
            <p>- self-contained single HTML file.</p>
            <p>- cross-browser, mobile friendly</p>
            <p>Limits:</p>
            <p>- do not ask for clarifications.</p>
            <p>- just show me the final HTML file.</p>
            <p>- if you can not do this task, just create a web page explaining why not.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I parsed this prompt by extracting the key points and structuring them into a web page format. I then generated the HTML code for this page, ensuring it met the specified requirements of being a single HTML file and mobile-friendly.</p>
