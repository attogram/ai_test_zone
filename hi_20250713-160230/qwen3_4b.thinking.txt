Okay, the user just said "hi". I need to respond appropriately. Let me think about how to greet them back. Maybe start with a friendly greeting. I should keep it simple and welcoming. Let me check if there's any specific context I need to consider, but since they just said "hi", it's probably a general greeting. I'll respond with a cheerful "Hello!" and ask how I can assist them. That should be good.
