This script seems to be a bash shell script designed to run prompts against various models in ollama, generate results as web pages, and save them in the specified directory. The code appears to be well-structured, but there are some minor improvements that can be suggested:

1. Add shebang comments at the top of the file if missing.
2. Use `set -euo pipefail` at the beginning of the script to ensure strict interpretation of the script and prevent security vulnerabilities.
3. Avoid using strings for command execution. Instead, use arrays to store commands or split them into smaller functions.
4. Improve variable naming by making it more descriptive and follow bash's conventional variable name case (all lowercase with underscores).
5. Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
6. Add comments explaining the purpose of each function and complex logic blocks.

Overall, the code is clean and well-structured, but incorporating these suggestions will make it even better.
