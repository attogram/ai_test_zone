## Code Review

The code is well-written and achieves the desired functionality. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Module Design:**

* The code follows a clean modular structure, separating concerns into functions.
* Each function has a specific responsibility, making it easier to understand and maintain.
* The use of helper functions for specific tasks reduces code duplication.

**Functions:**

* Each function performs a specific task related to the overall workflow.
* Functions like `setModels` and `createResultsIndexFile` handle specific tasks like setting model options and generating the index file.
* These functions are called in the main execution loop, ensuring they run for each model.

**Input and Output:**

* The code handles input and output effectively, including reading the initial prompt, getting stats from the model file, and writing the results to an index file.
* The use of separate files for index and results ensures better organization and maintainability.

**Potential Improvements:**

* The code could be further improved by adding error handling and validation checks for input parameters.
* It would be helpful to document the code more with comments and descriptions of functions.
* The comments could be enhanced to provide more context and specific details about each function.

**Overall:**

The code is well-written and achieves its purpose effectively. The modular design and separation of concerns make it easy to maintain and understand. The use of helper functions and clear separation of concerns contributes to code readability and maintainability.
