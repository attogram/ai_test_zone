This is the solution: There are two reasons:

 - The sky is blue because it reflects light, which causes a drop of water vapor on it.
 - Someone has created an alien planet! This planet was made by a rogue alien, so if they want to destroy us, we must do it ourselves first, which means that they can't be the same as us.

This is why our earth and the sky are connected by a giant cable, called a solar system, which runs on electricity. In addition, there are many other unnamed organisms which cause various effects (like rain) at will, such as a storm, but for now we can ignore them.

In order to prevent the rogue alien from destroying our planet, they have to prevent us from getting closer to it first. In order to do this, they must set up something called an asteroid belt. An asteroid is anything that orbits the Sun in a circular orbit around its center. The asteroid will eventually come crashing down on the earth, and if there are enough of them, they will be able to destroy us all.

The problem is: you don't know where our planet is located! Even though we have a lot of information about it (its size, the number of moons in it, its gravity), all that information is just guesswork, and can be easily faked as well. However, there's one thing that we definitely know - there are asteroids on every planet at some point: they're called Earth-based asteroids!

That means that if we get closer to the sun from earth-based asteroid belts (we have a huge amount of them), we will find our planet! This is what happens in this video. The aliens can't even see us, because they only watch the sky (a 3D model of the night sky). In addition, there's one little detail that I don't know how to explain - when it comes to earth-based asteroids, it has a different gravity from other planets' asteroids. This means that when we get closer to the sun, our planet will move in a different direction!

But what if you think about it? If we can use this "different direction" and go back in time as far as possible before we find our planet, then it's just a matter of luck which asteroid we'll be able to find first. This is how gravity works: we always move in the direction opposite to the force pushing us!

It's not that easy, though... If you take an example from the video and change the time in the past (e.g., 10 seconds ago) when you saw our planet, then you would be able to find it before the aliens do! But what if the aliens only have a few seconds to think about what will happen?

That's why we need some new tools - quantum computers. Quantum computers are basically computers that can see everything. They're really good at thinking, but they require superpowers that ordinary computers don't have - namely, their ability to change their internal state and the speed of time. We don't know how to use a quantum computer yet (because it would take too much computing power), so we'll just assume for now that it has all these powers...

This is the video. There are 10 seconds of time where you can see the moon (the only thing left out in the video) - you'll need to find this moon! Here's how:

 - Take a picture of one of the two moons and put it somewhere in your mind. You could even make a model of it! It doesn't really matter, but I wanted something that you're familiar with.
 - Make a new photo with a green star at its center (the position in time when you saw this moon). Now move the moon around until you see this new image. This is called "phase-finding". If the moon moves too slowly, then it's still very close to our planet! So that means we need to find something else - a way of making the moon move faster (if possible).
 - Take some pictures and make another photo with the star at the position when you saw the second moon. Now move this new image around until you see an image with a different color, which is not red! If there are any other colors, it means that something is wrong in this phase-finding method (and probably also in gravity).
 - Continue doing all of these steps and make some images with stars on the moon. You will get more images with different colors as you go along: red means your planet, yellow means a big asteroid belt, green means small asteroid belts and blue means that the moon is not moving anymore (this happens when we return to earth).
 - Now that the moons are moving fast enough in different directions, let's move them around again... but this time we'll do it with our eyes closed! We have a special device which can detect if there's an object nearby. If there isn't one, we know something is wrong and should turn on some kind of diagnostic mode - the only thing that you need to make sure of now is that the speed of the moon changes every time you move it around (because otherwise it would be very easy for us to guess when it'll return).
 - You will have to keep doing this step until you see our planet. If we find it, then we're done! The only thing left out in the video is that there are other unnamed entities which cause effects at random time intervals (like wind), but they can be ignored for now...

This is all I know - if you want to learn more about this topic, I recommend watching this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3sJ6_40d2I&t=819s . There are some other resources that I used in order to solve the problem and it's all available on Google!

For those who are interested, here is my solution:

 - Find an image of one of the moons. My model is a moon with the following characteristics (which we can find by clicking this link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon):
   - Moon diameter: 1392 km
 - Make another photo, but don't move it around yet! Instead, make a new image with a star at its center. This is the time where you saw your moon (which you'll see again in a few seconds). Here's what I made:
