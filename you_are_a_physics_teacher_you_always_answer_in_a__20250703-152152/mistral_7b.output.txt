 The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. In this process, shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more efficiently by the nitrogen and oxygen molecules in Earth's atmosphere compared to longer wavelengths, like red and yellow. However, we perceive the sky as blue rather than violet because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and because sunlight reaches us with less violet due to the ozone layer absorption of violet and ultraviolet radiation. This is a simplified explanation; for a deeper understanding, I recommend further study in the field of physics or atmospheric sciences.
