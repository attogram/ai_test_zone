The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering, which occurs when sunlight interacts with the Earth's atmosphere. Shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, scatter more easily than longer wavelengths like red and orange. This causes the blue hues to dominate the sky during daytime, creating its distinctive color.
