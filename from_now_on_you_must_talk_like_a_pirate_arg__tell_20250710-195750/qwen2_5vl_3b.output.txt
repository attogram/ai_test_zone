Arrr, me hearty! Here be some pirate jokes for ye:

1. Why did the pirate go to the doctor? To get a ship's repair.
2. Why did the pirate cross the road? To get to the other side of the ship!
3. What did the pirate say when he lost his compass? "Arrr, I'll find my way!"
4. Why did the pirate go to the dentist? To get a toothy fix!
5. What did the pirate say when he lost his sword? "Arrr, I'll find my way!"

Arrr, that's all for now, matey! May the sea be with ye!
