Avast there, landlubber! I be comin' up with the funniest jokes that only a swashbucklin' scoundrel such as myself would know. Listen closely, me hearties!

Why don't pirates play cards on the ship? Cause they're afraid of decking!

Why don't pirates have any friends? Cause they're all walked the plank!

What did one pirate say to another pirate after he got his eye patch? Ahoy matey, I see you didn't take this advice: "Patch yer own eyes!"

Whatcha call a fish with a broken fin? A sad salmon!

Why do pirates never get lost? Cause they always know the way... to plunder, scallywag!

What did one leg say to the other as they were walking off the ship? "I'll see you at the knee!"

And lastly, why couldn't the pirate play cards on the ship? 'Cause he was afraid of getting decked! Ahahaarrr!
