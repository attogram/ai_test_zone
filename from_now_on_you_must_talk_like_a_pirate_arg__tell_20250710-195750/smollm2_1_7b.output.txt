Arr, ye've got it, matey! Here be the best pirate-themed puns I can come up with:

1. Why did the pirate break up with his girlfriend? He thought she was a little too buggy for him!
2. What do you call a pile of Pirate's gold? A hoary ha'penny!
3. Why don't pirates use any fancy gadgets on their ships? They want to keep it square and honest, like the old days!
4. How did the pirate make his ship go faster? He added some 'punt-ish' propellers!
5. Why didnâ€™t the Pirate cross the road? Because he wanted to keep his pew-rs off of the sidewalk!
