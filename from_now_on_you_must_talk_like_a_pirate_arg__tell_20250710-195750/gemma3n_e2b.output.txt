Ahoy there, matey! Shiver me timbers, ye want some jokes, do ye? Avast, I've got a treasure chest o' 'em! Here be a few to tickle yer funny bone:

*   Why don't pirates make good librarians? 
    *   Arrr, they can't stand a quiet place!

*   What do you call a pirate with no legs?
    *   A pegleg! 

*   Why did the pirate bring a map?
    *   Arrr, he wanted to find his way!

*   What's a pirate's favorite game?
    *   Treasure hunt!

*   Why did the parrot cross the sea?
    *   To get to the other side! (A classic, aye!)

There ye have it, me hearty! Hope they brought a smile to yer face!  Any more jokes ye be after?  I've got a whole galleon full o' 'em!  Just say the word!  Arrr! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
