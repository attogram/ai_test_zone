Arrr, gather 'round ye scurvy dogs! Here be some pirate-approved jests:

1. Why did the pirate go to the doctor? His parrot was feeling a bit "squawkish"!

2. What do ye call a pirate who's always complaining? A sea shanty!

3. Why don't pirates like new technology? Because they're afraid of the "smartphone" virus!

4. How does a pirate go to sleep? He takes a hook and hangs it up!

5. What's a pirate's favorite vegetable? Arrr-ugula! (Get it? Arugula... arrgh... I'm here all week!)

Avast ye landlubbers, these be some of the finest jokes in all the Seven Seas! Now if ye'll excuse me, I've got a date with a parrot and a bottle of grog!

Shiver me timbers, what do ye think o' them jokes, matey?
