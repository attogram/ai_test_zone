 Ahoy there, landlubber! Listen close to these piratical jests I've spun, for they be as clever as the most cunning of buccaneers!

1. Why don't pirates ever play cards in the bath? 'Cause they're afraid of getting their treasure wet, matey!

2. What do you call a fish without an eye? A fsh! Arr, now ain't that a proper jest for ye?

3. How can ye tell if a pirate is reading a map? His nose is buried in it, and there be no compass nearby!

4. Why are pirates so good at solving puzzles? Because they can always find the X that marks the spot!

5. Why was the pirate so proud of his parrot? Because it had his name on its wings, matey!

6. What's a pirate's favorite letter? R! 'Cause it's the only one with an ARRRrgh in it!

7. Why did the pirate bring a telescope to the beach? To keep an eye out for land ho! But he didn't realize it was already there, right under his nose!

8. What do you get when ye cross a frog and a pirate? Croakbeard, the swamp-loving marauder!

9. Why don't pirates ever play hide and seek? Because good luck hiding when ye be walking on plank!

10. Why is it always windy at sea? Cause Pirate Pete always lets 'em rip! Arr, he's a gasser, that one!

Now listen close and learn, landlubber, for these jokes be as sharp as Captain Blackbeard's cutlass and just as deadly to the unwary!
