To solve this problem, we need to process a file containing information about different sections such as architecture, parameters, and systems. The goal is to extract specific values into dictionaries based on given rules.

### Approach
1. **Read Input File**: Read all non-empty lines from the input file after skipping the header line.
2. **Extract Model Dictionary**: Process each line that starts with "name" followed by a value. Store these in `model_dict`.
3. **Process Other Lines**: After extracting the model dictionary, handle any remaining lines for other sections such as parameters and systems if necessary.

### Solution Code
```python
def get_info():
    # Read all non-empty lines from parameter.txt after stripping whitespace
    with open('parameter.txt', 'r') as f:
        content = [line.strip() for line in f.read().splitlines() if line.strip()]
    
    model_dict = {}
    system_prompt = None
    capability_list = []
    parameters_dict = {}  # Placeholder for other section processing
    
    for line in content[1:]:  # Skip the first line which is 'Model'
        parts = line.split()
        
        if len(parts) == 2:
            name_part, value_part = parts
            name = name_part.lower()
            try:
                value = ' '.join(value_part).lower()
                model_dict[name] = value
            except ValueError:
                pass
    
    # Process other lines for parameters and system prompt
    if content[1]:
        for line in content:
            parts = line.split()
            if len(parts) >= 3 and all(p.isalpha() for p in parts[:3]):
                key = 'parameters' + ' '.join(parts[-2:]) if not any(word.isdigit() or word.lower() == 's' for word in parts[:-1]) else ''
                parameters_dict[key] = value
            elif len(parts) >= 3 and (parts[0].lower() == 'system'):
                system_prompt = ' '.join(parts[1:])
    
    # Extract capability list if lines have single words after name processing
    capability_list = []
    for line in content:
        parts = line.split()
        if len(parts) > 2 and all(word.isalpha() and len(word) == 1 for word in parts[:3]):
            value = ' '.join(parts[1:]).lower().replace('$', 'd').replace(':', 'h')
            capability_list.append(value)
    
    return model_dict, capability_list, parameters_dict, system_prompt

# Example usage:
# result = get_info()
# print(result['model_dict'])  # Output example from problem
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The function reads all non-empty lines after the header line to process subsequent data.
2. **Model Dictionary**: Lines that start with "name" followed by a value are processed into `model_dict`, converting names to lowercase and values to lowercase before storing.
3. **Other Sections Processing**: 
   - For parameters, it looks for single-word lines starting from index 1.
   - It also processes possible system prompt sections if any line starts with "system".
4. **Extracting capability List**: This section handles lines that might have multiple words but only take the first word as a value.

This approach ensures that each part of the file is processed correctly, and specific variables are extracted based on their definitions.
