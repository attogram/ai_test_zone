<p>Thinking: deepseek-r1:1.5b (<a href='./deepseek_r1_1_5b.thinking.txt'>raw</a>)<br />
<textarea readonly rows='15'>Okay, so I need to write a Python function that parses data from a model.info.txt file. Let me see how to approach this.

First, let me understand the structure of the input file. It looks like it has different sections: Model, Capabilities, System, and License. Each section has either lines or keywords.

In the Model section, each line is in the format &quot;name    value&quot;. For each line, I need to save the name as a Python variable using $value. So for example, if a line is &quot;architecture granite&quot;, I&#39;ll set architecture = &quot;granite&quot;.

The Capabilities section has multiple lines with single keywords. All these should be saved into a Python array.

System and License sections are a bit different because they have either one or more lines. System&#39;s lines show system prompts, so each line is a separate var $systemPrompt. Wait, but the example shows that System&#39;s prompt is one line: &quot;A chat...&quot;. So does that mean System&#39;s prompt is stored as a single variable name? I think yes. So in the input file, if there are multiple lines for System or License, they each become a separate variable.

But looking back at the example, it seems like the System section has only one line: &quot;Projector...&quot;. But according to the initial description, System can have multiple or single lines of system prompt. So I need to handle that by splitting each line into variables.

Wait, in the example model.info.txt, under System, there&#39;s a projector line with architecture clip and parameters 441.86M, etc. But for System, it says single or multiple lines showing the system prompt. Hmm, perhaps the system prompt is displayed as text, but in the file, each line represents a separate prompt. Or maybe each line is a single keyword.

Wait, looking at the example given:

In the Example model.info.txt contents, under System, there&#39;s one line: &quot;Projector...&quot;. So does that mean only one system prompt? But according to the problem statement, any number of lines may be present in the System section. Wait, but in the example, it shows a single line for System and no multiple lines.

Wait, maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding. Let me re-read the initial instructions.

The user said:

- In the Model section, each line is parsed into name=&quot;$value&quot;.

- In the Capabilities section, each line is saved as a Python array.

- In the System section, single or multiple lines showing the system prompt. Each line is a keyword? Or perhaps each line is an individual prompt.

Wait, in the example, under System: &quot;A chat between...&quot;. So maybe that&#39;s one prompt line. But according to the problem statement, any number of lines can be present in the System section, so I need to handle that by splitting into separate variables.

Same for License: each line is a keyword? Or perhaps only one keyword?

Wait, looking at the example under License:

Apache License
Version 2.0, January 2004
...

So two lines here. So in that case, does each of those lines become a separate variable? Or maybe it&#39;s treated as multiple keywords for the same token.

But according to the problem statement: &quot;each line is a single keyword&quot;. Wait, no, under Capabilities and System, each section has lines with either one or more items. But for System, in the example, there are lines showing system prompts, but perhaps only one prompt per line? Or multiple?

Wait, I think I need to read the problem statement carefully.

The user provided an example model.info.txt:

Model:
Architecture granite
...
System:
A chat...

So under System, it&#39;s a single line. But according to the initial instructions: &quot;Single or multiple lines showing the system prompt&quot;. So perhaps in that case, each of those lines is a separate variable name?

Wait, but then how many variables would be created? Maybe it&#39;s better to parse all lines in the section and split them into individual keyword names.

So for System:

If there are N lines, we create N variables like $systemPrompt1, $systemPrompt2, etc., each containing the line content. But wait, looking at the example: only one line under System. So perhaps it&#39;s treated as a single variable.

But then again, maybe the system prompt is multiple lines? Or perhaps it&#39;s displayed as text, and in the file, each line represents an individual keyword for $systemPrompt.

Wait, but in the example, the System section has &quot;A chat...&quot;. That&#39;s one line. So that would be treated as a single variable name: $systemPrompt1 = &quot;A chat...&quot;.

But according to the problem statement, perhaps the system prompt is displayed as text and each line represents an individual keyword.

Wait, but in the example provided by the user, only the System section has one line under it. So maybe I should proceed accordingly.

Similarly for License: multiple lines mean separate variables.

So putting this together:

1. Split the input into sections based on &#39;section&#39; key.
2. For each section:
   - Model: split into lines, each is name=value, save as variable.
   - Capabilities: split into lines, all are keywords, add to array.
   - System: split into lines, each line is a keyword (could be multiple), add each as variable.
   - License: same logic.

Wait, but in the example given by the user:

Model has architecture, parameters, etc., all lines. So it&#39;s parsed as variables.

Capabilities: four lines, each line a keyword. They are added to the array.

System section: one line, which is a prompt. It&#39;s treated as a single variable name.

Wait, but in the example given by the user under System:

&quot;A chat between...&quot;. That&#39;s one line. So it would become $systemPrompt1 = &quot;A chat ...&quot;.

But according to the initial instructions, maybe each line in System represents an individual keyword? Or perhaps it&#39;s treated as a single variable name.

Wait, but then in that case, the example under System would have only one line, leading to just one variable. But I think the user may be mistaken because in reality, the system prompt is displayed as multiple lines if there are multiple prompts. Or maybe each line is part of an individual keyword, such as &#39;chat&#39;, &#39;user&#39;, etc.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

&quot;In the System section, single or multiple lines showing the system prompt.&quot;

Ah, so perhaps in the System section, any number of lines can be present, and each line is a separate variable name. Or maybe it&#39;s treated as multiple variables for the same token.

But in the example given by the user, under System: &quot;A chat between...&quot;. That&#39;s one line. So that would become $systemPrompt1 = &quot;A chat ...&quot;.

Wait, but perhaps the system prompt is displayed as a single line with text, and each line represents an individual keyword? Or perhaps it&#39;s treated as multiple lines, each being a separate keyword.

This is a bit ambiguous, so I need to clarify.

In the example given by the user under System, there is only one line. So according to that, the system prompt would be represented by one variable name: $systemPrompt1 = &quot;A chat ...&quot;.

But perhaps in reality, multiple lines could exist for System prompts, each being a separate keyword.

Wait, but looking at the example given in the initial response (the user&#39;s own response), it shows:

In the System section, single or multiple lines showing the system prompt. The assistant&#39;s prompt is &quot;A chat between...&quot;.

So perhaps the line with the prompt is treated as a single variable name: $systemPrompt1.

But according to the problem statement, that might not be accurate because in reality, multiple lines can represent different parts of the prompt, each being individual keywords. So perhaps for System section, all lines are parsed and split into individual variables.

So I think the approach is:

- For any section (Model, Capabilities, System, License), if a line exists:
   - Split the line into tokens using whitespace.
   - If it&#39;s a single token, add as an array element or assign to $systemPrompt.
   - If multiple tokens, each becomes a separate variable.

But wait, in Model and Capabilities sections, each section has lines which are either one or more items. So perhaps for these sections:

- Split into lines.
- For each line:
   - Split into tokens (split by whitespace)
   - If the line is in model.info.txt under &quot;Model&quot;, then each token is a name-value pair.
     Each such token becomes a variable in Python.

But wait, according to the initial instructions, Model&#39;s lines are &quot;name    value&quot;. So each line has two parts: name and value. But looking at the example content:

In the example model.info.txt, under Model:
 architecture        granite    
parameters          2.5B       
...

So each line is like &quot;name    value&quot;, but in code, it&#39;s split by whitespace, so it becomes [&quot;name&quot;, &quot;value&quot;].

But according to the problem statement: for Model section, each line is name    value. So for each such line, we have a variable, e.g., name=&quot;$value&quot;.

So perhaps, in the case of the Model section, all lines are variables.

Similarly, in Capabilities and System sections, any line that&#39;s not part of other sections should be considered as keywords, but wait no: the problem statement says:

In the Model section, each line is parsed into a variable name. So for the Model section, even if it contains multiple lines, all are used to create variables.

Wait, but in the example model.info.txt, under Model, there are multiple lines. But according to the initial instructions, I should split each line into two parts (name and value) and assign each name as a variable.

But perhaps the user intended that the Model section&#39;s lines are all names and their values, so for each line in Model:

split into parts on whitespace: [name, value]
assign variables[name] = &quot;value&quot;

Similarly, Capabilities is separate. Each line is a keyword, which should be added to an array.

System and License sections can have multiple or one lines, but according to the problem statement, any number of lines may be present in System and License sections.

Wait, no: under Model, each section has its own lines. So for example:

Model:
 architecture        granite    
parameters          2.5B       
...

So each line is a model property.

Capabilities:
    completion    
    tools         
    vision        

Each line is a keyword, added to the array.

System:
    A chat between...
    ...
Multiple lines: each is parsed into variables like $systemPrompt1, $systemPrompt2, etc., if there are multiple lines.

Similarly for License:

Apache License
Version 2.0, January 2004
...

Each line is a keyword, so all are added to the array.

So now, the plan is:

- Read the input file into a list of sections.
- For each section:
   - Split into lines.
   - If it&#39;s Model: split each line into two parts, name and value. Each becomes a variable in Python (name=&quot;$value&quot;).
   - If it&#39;s Capabilities: split into lines; all are keywords added to an array.
   - If it&#39;s System or License: split into lines; if multiple lines, each is a keyword assigned to $systemPrompt1, $systemPrompt2, etc. But wait, according to the initial problem statement, System and License sections can have one or more lines for system prompt. So in that case, each line in these sections would be individual variables.

Wait, but looking at the example given by the user:

In the Model section, after architecture comes parameters. So perhaps all those are parsed into variables, regardless of how many lines they have.

Similarly, the System&#39;s first line is a single prompt line with &quot;Projector...&quot;.

So according to that, if in any section (Model, Capabilities, System, License), there are multiple lines, each should be split and assigned as separate variables.

Wait, but then for Capabilities and System, their lines are keywords. So the user wants all lines in the Capabilities and System sections as keywords? Or perhaps each line is a keyword?

This is confusing because according to the problem statement:

- In the Model section, each line is parsed into a variable (name=&quot;$value&quot;).
- In the Capabilities section, each line is saved as a Python array.
- In the System section, single or multiple lines showing the system prompt. Each line is a keyword? Or perhaps it&#39;s treated as an array of keywords.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, for System, any number of lines can be present. It says &quot;each line is a keyword&quot;, which suggests that each line represents a single keyword. But in reality, the system prompt might consist of multiple prompts per line? Or perhaps it&#39;s displayed as text and each line in the file is part of that text.

But given that in the example under System, there is only one line, I think each such line should be treated as an individual variable for $systemPrompt. So all lines in any section are parsed into variables named $section_name, unless specified otherwise.

Wait, but perhaps the problem statement is a bit conflicting.

Looking back: The user provided an example of the contents:

In the Example model.info.txt, under Model, each line after architecture is a separate line for the model&#39;s properties. So I think that in the Model section, all lines are treated as variable names and assigned to variables.

Similarly, in Capabilities: each line is a keyword added to the array.

In System: perhaps each line is a keyword (like &#39;chat&#39;, &#39;user&#39;) or maybe not? Or perhaps it&#39;s a keyword for $systemPrompt.

But according to the problem statement, in the System section:

- Each line represents a single keyword. But that can&#39;t be because then if there are multiple lines under System, they would all be added as separate keywords, which may not make sense. Alternatively, each line is part of the system prompt, and thus becomes an individual variable.

But perhaps the problem statement meant that in the System section, any number of lines represent one keyword each, but that seems unlikely because typically a system prompt is only displayed once.

Wait, I think the correct interpretation is that for all sections except Capabilities (where each line is a keyword), Model and System have their lines parsed into variables or keywords. For Capabilities, each line is added to the array. For System and License, perhaps each line represents an individual keyword in $systemPrompt, but I&#39;m not sure.

Wait, no: according to the problem statement:

- In the System section, single or multiple lines showing the system prompt.

So that suggests that each of those lines are part of the system prompt, and thus should be parsed into variables. So perhaps each line is a keyword in $systemPrompt.

But looking at the example under System, it&#39;s a single line: &quot;A chat between...&quot;. So according to this, only one variable would be created for $systemPrompt1 = that text.

But wait, perhaps multiple lines are part of the system prompt. Or maybe each line is considered as an individual keyword and thus needs to be parsed into separate variables.

So in summary:

- Model: Each line after name=value becomes a Python variable (name=&quot;$value&quot;).
- Capabilities: Each line is added to an array.
- System: Each line represents a keyword for $systemPrompt, so each line should be split and assigned as variables.
- License: Each line is a keyword added to the array.

Wait, but in that case, how would the example under System have multiple lines? It&#39;s only one line. So perhaps the problem statement intended that under System section, each line is a separate keyword for $systemPrompt. Therefore, if there are N lines under System, create N variables, each being the line content.

But wait, in the example given by the user, under System: &quot;A chat between...&quot; is one line. So it would be split into [&quot;chat&quot;, &quot;between...&quot;] and thus two variables? Or perhaps that line is just a single keyword which is assigned as $systemPrompt1 = &quot;A chat ...&quot;.

This seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps in the problem statement, the lines under System should also be considered as individual keywords for $systemPrompt. So each line would split into multiple tokens (words), and if there are two words, assign to $systemPrompt1 and $systemPrompt2, etc.

So I think that&#39;s the correct approach: treat all lines in any section as keywords, and split them into individual words, treating each word as a separate variable.

But wait, for Model and Capabilities sections:

- Model: Each line is two tokens (name=value), so assign to variables.
- Capabilities: Each line is one token (keyword), add to array.

For System and License:

Each line is multiple tokens, which are individual words. So each word becomes a variable name assigned as $variable = &quot;word&quot;.

Wait, but that might not be correct because in the example given by the user, under System, it&#39;s a single line with architecture clip and parameters 441M, etc., which would split into two tokens per line.

So perhaps all lines in any section are treated as keywords to assign to variables.

But according to the problem statement:

- In Model: each line is parsed into name=&quot;$value&quot;.
- So if a line has multiple words (like &quot;projector architecture&quot;), that&#39;s not applicable because Model only has names and values. Wait, but looking back, in the example, under Model there are lines like &quot;parameters 2.5B&quot; which split into two tokens.

So perhaps all sections&#39; lines are parsed as per their content:

- Model: each line is name=value.
- Capabilities: each line is a keyword (single token).
- System and License: any line with multiple words, each word becomes an individual variable (e.g., $systemPrompt1 = &quot;word&quot;).

Wait, but that would require handling the lines differently for Model and other sections.

Alternatively, perhaps all sections treat lines as keywords except Model, which uses name=value. But I&#39;m not sure.

But according to the problem statement:

The initial instructions are:

- Model: each line is parsed into a variable.
- Capabilities: each line added to an array.
- System: single or multiple lines for system prompt. Each line is treated as part of that prompt, so perhaps each line should be split and assigned as separate variables.

But this seems conflicting with the example given in the problem statement.

Wait, looking at the initial problem statement again:

In the Model section: each line is parsed into a variable (name=&quot;$value&quot;).

So lines like &quot;parameters 2.5B&quot; would have two parts, which are name and value.

For Capabilities: each line is a keyword added to an array.

System and License sections: they can have one or more lines, but according to the problem statement, any number of lines may be present in these sections, with each being considered as a keyword for $systemPrompt. So if there are two lines under System, create two variables: $systemPrompt1 = &quot;line1&quot;, $systemPrompt2 = &quot;line2&quot;.

Similarly, for License.

But wait, in the problem statement&#39;s example given by the user:

Under Model:
 architecture        granite    
parameters          2.5B       
...

So that would split into [&quot;architectures&quot;, &quot;granite&quot;], [&quot;parameters&quot;, &quot;2.5B&quot;] and so on. So each line has two tokens: name and value.

Therefore, for Model sections, all lines should be parsed as:

Split the line into parts by whitespace, take first part as variable name, second as value. Assign accordingly.

For Capabilities: Each line is a single keyword (split by whitespace) added to an array.

For System: each line&#39;s tokens are assigned as variables. So if a line has multiple words, they become separate $systemPrompt1, $systemPrompt2, etc., based on the number of words in that line.

Similarly for License: lines split into words and each is a keyword assigned to $license_name.

But this would mean:

In the Model section, any line with more than two tokens (e.g., &quot;projector architecture&quot;) should have only two parts: name (the first token) and value (second). The rest are ignored? Or perhaps such lines are considered as invalid for Model sections?

Wait, according to the problem statement&#39;s example:

The user&#39;s example includes under Model a line like &quot;parameters 2.5B&quot; which is correctly split into two tokens.

But in code, how do we handle that? We can assume that all model lines will have exactly two parts, but perhaps other code could read more or less.

Wait, the problem statement says: each section&#39;s content:

Model: name=value.
Capabilities: keywords added to an array.
System and License: individual keywords or multiple system prompt lines.

So in this case, we should process all lines as follows:

- Model: split into two parts per line. Each part becomes a variable.
- Capabilities: split each line into one part (keyword) which is added to the array.
- System: if a line has more than two words, how do we handle? Like &quot;projector architecture parameters&quot; would be three tokens.

Wait, according to the problem statement, in the Model section, lines are parsed as name=value. So perhaps lines with multiple parts (more than two) should not occur, or should be treated as only taking first two and ignoring others?

But this is unclear. The initial code sample given by the user includes &quot;parameters 2.5B&quot; which has two words.

Wait, looking at the problem statement&#39;s example, it shows under Model:

 architecture        granite    
parameters          2.5B       
...

Which suggests that each line in Model will have exactly two tokens: name and value.

So perhaps any lines with more or less tokens can be assumed to be part of an error, but for the purpose of this problem, we&#39;ll assume that all model lines are parsed correctly into name and value.

For System:

If a line has multiple words (e.g., &quot;chat between&quot;), then each word is a separate $systemPrompt variable. So in code, after splitting by whitespace, if len(words) &gt; 1, assign each to $variable, with the first being system prompt 1, second system prompt 2, etc.

Same for license lines: each word becomes a keyword assigned to $license variable, regardless of how many words there are.

So now, putting it all together:

Read the input file into sections.

Sections:

- Model: each line is two tokens (name and value). Assign name to variable in Python.
- Capabilities: each line is one token. Add to array.
- System: any line with 1 or more words. Split by whitespace, assign first word to $systemPrompt1, second to $systemPrompt2, etc.
- License: each line is split into words; each becomes a keyword in Python.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, for System and License sections, lines are treated as keywords? Or perhaps:

- For Model, lines have two tokens (name=value).
- For Capabilities, each line has one token (keyword) added to array.
- For System: if a line is, say, &quot;chat 2&quot;, then the system prompt would be assigned to $systemPrompt1 = &quot;chat&quot; and $systemPrompt2 = &quot;2&quot;? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps lines in System section should also be treated as keywords, meaning each word becomes a keyword for $variable.

But according to the problem statement, under System&#39;s example:

In the user&#39;s example, under System: &quot;A chat between...&quot; is one line. So that would split into two tokens and create one $systemPrompt1 variable.

Wait, but perhaps in the actual code, when you parse each line of any section, all lines are considered as keywords except Model, which has name=value.

But this seems inconsistent with the initial problem statement&#39;s example.

Alternatively, perhaps all sections should be treated as keyword assignments except Model, which is handled differently.

Hmm. But according to the user&#39;s example in the content:

In System&#39;s section: &quot;A chat between...&quot; would split into two tokens and create $systemPrompt1 = that string.

But then how does a line with three words work? For example:

&quot;A project 2023&quot; as one line.

Split into [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;project&quot;, &quot;2023&quot;], which are then assigned to $variable1, $var2, $var3?

That would create three variables in Python.

But perhaps that&#39;s what is intended: each word in any section is a keyword for $variable, regardless of the name of the section. So lines in System and License sections are treated as keyword assignments, not as part of a system prompt line.

Wait, but according to the problem statement:

- In the System section, single or multiple lines showing the system prompt.

So if there&#39;s one line under System: &quot;chat between...&quot;, split into two tokens, create $systemPrompt1 = that string.

If there are two lines: &quot;chat 2023&quot; and &quot;user 2024&quot;, then assign to $systemPrompt1 = first token, $systemPrompt2 = second token. So each word in the line becomes a keyword for $variable.

Similarly for License:

Each line is split into words; if a line has N words, create N keywords (variables) in Python.

So now, given that, I think the processing steps are as follows:

1. Read all lines from the file into sections.
2. Split each section&#39;s content by line separators.
3. For each section:
   - Model: split each line into two parts (name and value). Assign to variable name = &quot;value&quot;.
   - Capabilities: split each line into one part (keyword). Append to array.
   - System: split each line into words; assign first word as $variable1, second as $var2, etc. So if a line has 3 parts, create 3 variables in Python.
   - License: split each line into words; assign each word to a variable named as the line&#39;s content.

Wait, but that might not align with the user&#39;s example where System has only one line. Because according to this processing, that single line would create $systemPrompt1 = &quot;chat between...&quot;.

But wait, in the problem statement&#39;s example by the user:

In the system section, it&#39;s a single line: &quot;A chat between...&quot; which is split into two tokens (chat and between...) and assigned as $systemPrompt1. So the text after &#39;chat&#39; would be part of that.

So if a line in System has multiple words beyond the first, those are treated as separate variables.

So for example:

In System&#39;s section:
Line 1: &quot;chat between Python&quot;
Split into [&quot;chat&quot;, &quot;between&quot;, &quot;Python&quot;]
Thus, create two $systemPrompt variables? No, wait, each word becomes a keyword. So split by whitespace, and each word is a variable name in Python.

Wait no, that would be incorrect. Because the line&#39;s words are treated as multiple system prompt keywords.

But according to the problem statement&#39;s initial instructions:

In System section: any number of lines for system prompt. Each is part of the system prompt.

So if there are two lines under System:
- Line 1: &quot;chat between Python&quot;
- Line 2: &quot;user code 2023&quot;

Then, each word in each line is a keyword for $variable. So:

Line 1 split into [&quot;chat&quot;, &quot;between&quot;, &quot;Python&quot;], so create three variables (system_prompt1 = chat, system_prompt2 = between, system_prompt3 = Python).

But that might be intended, but perhaps the problem expects only the first word to be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps in System and License sections, lines are treated as keyword assignments. So each line&#39;s first token is a variable name.

Wait, this requires further clarification.

But according to the initial code sample given by the user, the System section has one line with two words: &quot;chat between...&quot;, which when split into [&quot;chat&quot;, &quot;between...&quot;] would produce $variable = &#39;chat&#39; and another variable for the rest?

No. Because in Python, if we have a single token from splitting, it&#39;s just one variable.

Wait no:

When you have a line like &quot;chat between ...&quot;, that is two tokens: [&quot;chat&quot;, &quot;between...&quot;]. So when split into words, the first word becomes $variable1, second $var2. If a line has more than two words, for example, three, then each would be assigned to separate variables.

So in code:

For System lines:
split_line = line.strip().split()
for part in split_line:
    var_name = f&#39;system_prompt{i}&#39;
    exec(f&quot;setattr(__main__, var_name, {part})&quot;)

Wait no. But the problem is that we can&#39;t have multiple variable names like this because each line is a keyword assignment to one variable.

So perhaps:

For lines in System section (whether multiple or not), for each word in the split line, assign it as a separate variable name.

But wait, how many variables would that create? For example, if a line has 5 words, then we&#39;ll have 5 system_prompt variables assigned. Which is probably not desired.

Alternatively, perhaps only the first word of each System/License line is used as a keyword, and the rest are ignored or considered part of another syntax error.

But according to problem statement&#39;s example:

In Model section:
architectures and granite
parameters and 2.5B

So two words per line. So in code, model_line.split() would have len &gt;=1.

Thus, for lines with more than one word, the first word is used as the variable name.

But what about System lines?

Problem statement&#39;s example shows that under System section: &quot;A chat between...&quot; which has two tokens, so it creates $variable1 = &#39;chat&#39; and $var2 = &#39;between...&#39;.

So perhaps for System/License sections:

Each line&#39;s first word is treated as a keyword variable. The rest of the words in that line are ignored or considered part of an error.

But according to problem statement, each line under System should be a keyword assignment, meaning all parts are assigned as variables.

Hmm, I&#39;m getting stuck here.

Alternative approach: perhaps, for the purpose of this coding challenge, process each section as follows:

- Model:
   - Each line is split into exactly two words.
   - The first word becomes a Python variable named after that word (like archetectures).
   But wait, &#39;architectures&#39; and &#39;granite&#39; are the first two parts. So model_line.split() would be [&#39;architectures&#39;, &#39;granite&#39;].

But this creates variables named &#39;architectures&#39; and &#39;granite&#39;.

- Capabilities:
   - Each line is split into one word.
   - Append to array.

- System:
   - Split each line into words.
   - Take the first word as variable name.
   So for a line like &quot;chat between Python&quot;, create variable chat, then between, then Python. But that would be three variables in Python, which seems excessive but perhaps intended.

- License:
   - Each line is split into words.
   - Assign each word to a separate variable.

But wait, according to the problem statement:

In the System example given by the user, the line &quot;A chat between...&quot; has two words. So in code, this should create two variables: $variable1 = &#39;chat&#39;, $var2 = &#39;between...&#39;.

But if I have three words, it would be a third variable.

Alternatively, perhaps for System and License sections:

- Each line is processed into all of its tokens as keyword assignments to the same variable name. So if a line has multiple tokens, only the first token is used as a system prompt keyword, and the rest are ignored or errored out.

But this contradicts with the initial example where in Model: &#39;parameters 2.5B&#39; creates two variables.

Alternatively, perhaps for all sections except Model:

- Split into words.
- Assign each word to a separate variable in Python.

So in Model, lines split into two tokens; assign them as separate variables.

In other sections, lines are split by whitespace and each token is assigned as a keyword.

Thus, if a line in System has 5 words, it would create five $variable assignments. Which might not be desired but perhaps the problem expects that.

But this could lead to multiple variables being created which may or may not be intended.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should process all sections except Model by splitting into words and assigning each word as a variable name in Python, even if it&#39;s more than one word per line. So for example, System lines would create as many $variable assignments as the number of tokens in that line.

But that seems too broad.

Alternatively, perhaps:

For System and License sections:

Each line is split into words; each word is assigned to a keyword variable in Python. So if a line has 5 tokens, five variables are created.

Similarly for Model: lines split into two parts, two variables created.

Thus, given the initial problem statement&#39;s example where under System there is one line with two words, that would create two variables.

But perhaps I should proceed as such.

So putting this together:

Read each section in order.

For each section (Model, Capabilities, System, License):

- Split lines by whitespace.
- For Model: split into two parts. Assign to variable name = first part, value = second part.
- For Capabilities: split into one word. Append to the array.
- For System and License:
   - Take all words in the line as keyword assignments.

So for example:

Model&#39;s line &quot;parameters 2.5B&quot; → create &#39;parameters&#39; → &#39;2.5B&#39;.
Line &quot;project project&quot; → &#39;project&#39;, &#39;project&#39;.

Capabilities line &quot;test&quot; → array.append(&#39;test&#39;).

System&#39;s line &quot;chat between Python&quot; → split into [&#39;chat&#39;, &#39;between&#39;, &#39;Python&#39;] → add each to a variable: chat, between, Python in Python.

License line &quot;python3 code 2024&quot; → split into [&#39;python3&#39;, &#39;code&#39;, &#39;2024&#39;] → create variables python3, code, 2024.

Now, this could be what&#39;s intended for the problem.

Thus, now I can proceed to write the code accordingly.

So, steps in code:

1. Read the input file line by line.
2. Split into sections based on newlines or any whitespace.

Wait no: when reading from a file using standard methods (like read().split(&#39;\n&#39;)), each split(&#39;\n&#39;) gives a separate section. So I can use that approach.

But let&#39;s proceed.

Read all lines, stripping leading/trailing whitespace.

For each line:

If the first word is &#39;Model&#39;, then it&#39;s Model section processing.

Else if first word is &#39;Capabilities&#39;, process accordingly.

Else if first word is &#39;System&#39; or &#39;License&#39;, process as System/License.

Wait no: because &#39;Capitals&#39; would be a keyword, but according to problem statement.

But wait in the initial code sample, the user provided lines starting with Model, Capabilities, System, and License. So perhaps I can assume that the first token of each line is the section.

But this may not hold for all cases.

Alternatively, better to split into sections based on line structure.

Wait no: because a line could have multiple words. But according to problem statement&#39;s example, lines are in a way like:

Model:
architectures        granite    
parameters          2.5B       
...

So each line starts with section name (either Model, Capabilities, System, License) followed by its content.

Thus, perhaps we can split each line into tokens where the first token is the section, and the rest are part of that section&#39;s processing.

But how?

Hmm.

Alternatively, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it&#39;s easier to assume that the sections start with a single keyword (Model, Capabilities, System, License) followed by content. So each line is split into two parts: first word is section name, rest are part of processing.

So in code:

for line in lines:

   if line[0].lower() == &#39;model&#39;:

      process as Model

   elif line[0].lower() == &#39;capabilities&#39;:

      process as Capabilities

   elif line[0].lower() in (&#39;system&#39;, &#39;license&#39;):

      process accordingly

But wait, for example: a line like &quot;chat chat system&quot;

Which is split into two words: &#39;chat&#39; and &#39;chat system&#39;.

So the section name is &#39;chat&#39;? But that&#39;s not correct.

Hmm, but according to problem statement&#39;s initial content, lines are structured with one keyword per line. So perhaps we can assume that each line starts with a single word (section) followed by its data.

Thus, for this problem, it&#39;s safe to split the line into words and process accordingly.

So in code:

Read all lines from input file as a list.

Split into sections using any whitespace or newlines as delimiters.

For each section in order:

   if section starts with &#39;Model&#39;:

      for each word in the line.split():

          var = f&#39;model_{word[0]}&#39;

          setattr(__main__, var, word)

      So that&#39;s one part. But wait, in the initial example, lines have two parts (section and value).

Wait no:

In Model, each line is split into first word as section name, second as content.

But perhaps for multiple variables.

So if a line has &#39;parameters parameters&#39;, then var names are model_parameters and parameters_parameters.

Thus, for the Model processing:

tokens = line.split()

for i in range(len(tokens)):

   var_name = f&#39;model_{tokens[i].lower()}&#39;

   value = tokens[i]

   setattr(__main__, var_name, value)

Similarly for other sections:

Capabililties: each line is one token.

Process as array.append(value).

System/License: split into words. For all words in the line, assign as variable names.

Thus, for example, System line &#39;chat between python&#39; becomes:

chat = system_line

between = system_line

python = system_line

Which could lead to multiple variables assigned when a single keyword is present in the line.

But according to problem statement&#39;s initial example, in Model lines are two words (section and value), so code would correctly handle that.

Thus, this approach should work.

So now, putting this into code:

We&#39;ll have __main__ as a module where we can access all variables created.

Read all lines from input.

Split into sections: first line is the section name (&#39;Model&#39;, &#39;Capabilities&#39;, &#39;System&#39;, or &#39;License&#39;), then rest are the content.

For each section:

   if section starts with &#39;Model&#39;:

      for i, token in enumerate(line.split()):

          var_name = f&#39;model_{token.lower()}&#39;

          setattr(__main__, var_name, token)

   elif section == &#39;Capabilities&#39;:

      array.append(line[1])

   else: # System or License

      words = line.split()

      for word in words:

          setattr(__main__, word, None)  # Or leave as is?

But wait, in the initial example under System and License, we can see that all tokens are used.

Thus, code will handle it.

Now, testing this with the sample input given by user.

Sample Input lines (assuming they are from a file):

&quot;Model:\n\narchitectures\ngranite&quot;
&quot;Capabilities:\n\nproject\nproject&quot;
&quot;System:line1\n\nchat\nbetween\npython&quot;
&quot;License:\n\npython3\ncode\n2024&quot;

Thus, the sections:

Model section: [&#39;architectures&#39;, &#39;granite&#39;]

Capabililties: [&#39;project&#39;, &#39;project&#39;]

System line: [&#39;chat&#39;, &#39;between&#39;, &#39;python&#39;]

License line: [&#39;python3&#39;, &#39;code&#39;, &#39;2024&#39;]

Process each section.

Model processing:

Each token is split into two parts.

For archetectures, var_name is model_architectures = &#39;architectures&#39;

Granite becomes model_granites = &#39;granite&#39;.

Capabililties:

Append the next value (line[1] is &#39;project&#39;), so array = [&#39;project&#39;].

System processing:

words = [&#39;chat&#39;, &#39;between&#39;, &#39;python&#39;]

Each word becomes a variable name in __main__:

chat → system_chat

between → system_between

python → system_python

Thus, three variables created.

License processing: same as above but variables are named python3, code, 2024.

But looking at the initial example under System and License sections, only two tokens are present. So perhaps it&#39;s better to process all words as keyword assignments, regardless of how many they are.

Thus, in the system line &#39;chat between...&#39;, three variables will be created.

Now, what about a System section with multiple keywords?

For example:

&quot;System:line1\n\nchat\nsomething else\npython&quot;

Then, __main__ has three variables: chat, something else, python.

But according to problem statement&#39;s initial example, lines are structured as two words. So perhaps this is beyond the scope of the current problem and should be handled accordingly.

Thus, proceed with code as above.

Now, what about possible errors?

In the case where a line has more than one token for a section other than &#39;Model&#39;? For instance:

&quot;System:chat chat python&quot;

Which would create three variables. So in Python, when accessing __main__.chat, etc., which could be problematic, but according to problem statement&#39;s initial example, perhaps it is intended.

Thus, proceed as such.

So code outline:

__main__() returns a list of variables (including Model variables and the array).

Read all lines into a list.

Split into sections using any line separator.

For each section in order:

   if section starts with &#39;Model&#39;:

      for token in line.split():

          var_name = f&#39;model_{token.lower()}&#39;

          setattr(__main__, var_name, token)

   elif section == &#39;Capabilities&#39;:

      array.append(line[1])

Else: # System or License

      words = line.split()

      for word in words:

          setattr(__main__, word, None)  # Or leave as is?

But perhaps better to pass through without modification.

Thus, the code can be written as follows.</textarea>

<p>Output: deepseek-r1:1.5b (<a href='./deepseek_r1_1_5b.output.txt'>raw</a>)<br />
<textarea readonly rows='25'>
To solve this problem, we need to create a function that reads multiple lines of input and assigns each line to specific variables based on their section. The sections are structured such that the first word in each line corresponds to a particular type of data (e.g., &quot;Model&quot;, &quot;Capabilities&quot;, &quot;System&quot;, or &quot;License&quot;). Each subsequent word within these sections becomes a keyword assignment.

### Approach
1. **Reading Input**: Read all lines from the input file and split them into individual sections based on whitespace or newlines.
2. **Processing Model Section**: For each line in the Model section, split the line into two parts: the section name (first word) and the content. Assign these to variables starting with &quot;model_&quot;.
3. **Processing Capabilities Section**: Each line in the Capabilities section corresponds to a single keyword assignment.
4. **Processing System Section**: For each line in the System section, split the line into multiple parts and assign each part as a keyword variable.
5. **Processing License Section**: Similar to the System section, each line is split into multiple parts and assigned as keyword variables.

### Solution Code
```python
__main__ = {}

# Read all lines from input
import sys

lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]

sections = []
for i, line in enumerate(lines):
    if not line:
        continue  # skip empty lines
    section_name = line[0].lower()
    rest_of_line = line[i+1:] if i+1 &lt; len(line) else &#39;&#39;
    sections.append((section_name, rest_of_line))

# Process each section
for idx, (section_name, content) in enumerate(sections):
    if section_name == &#39;Model&#39;:
        for token in content.split():
            var_name = f&#39;model_{token.lower()}&#39;
            setattr(__main__, var_name, token)
    elif section_name == &#39;Capabilities&#39;:
        __main__.append(content[1] if len(content) &gt; 1 else &#39;&#39;)
    else:  # Either System or License
        words = content.split()
        for word in words:
            setattr(__main__, word, None)

print(__main__)
```

### Explanation
- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line and split into sections based on the first character of each line.
- **Model Section Processing**: Each line starting with &quot;Model&quot; is split into two parts: the section name (e.g., &quot;architectures&quot;) and the content. These are assigned as separate variables in a dictionary starting with &quot;model_&quot;.
- **Capabilities Section Processing**: Each line starting with &quot;Capabilities&quot; contains exactly one keyword assignment, which is appended to a list.
- **System and License Section Processing**: Each line starting with &quot;System&quot; or &quot;License&quot; contains multiple keywords. Each keyword is assigned as a variable in the global scope of the script.

This approach ensures that each section of input is correctly processed and assigned to appropriate variables efficiently.</textarea>
