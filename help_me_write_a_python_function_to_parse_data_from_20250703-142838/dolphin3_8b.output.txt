Here is a Python function that parses the data from your model.info.txt file:

```python
def parse_model_info(filename):
    variables = {}
    parameters = []
    system_prompt = ""
    temperature = ""

    with open(filename) as f:
        sections = [section.strip() for section in f.read().split("  \n") if section.strip()]

    current_section = None

    for line in sections:
        line = line.lstrip()
        if not line: continue
        name, value = line.split(maxsplit=1)

        if "=" in value and "system" not in name.lower() and "parameters" not in name.lower():
            name, value = value.split("=")
            variables[name.strip()] = value.strip()

        elif any(keyword in name for keyword in ["Model", "Capabilities", "Projector"]):
            current_section = name

        elif "temperature" == name:
            temperature = value

        elif "System" == current_section and line != "\n":
            system_prompt += f"{line}\n"

    parameters = [value for name, value in variables.items() if "parameters" in name]

    return {
        "variables": variables,
        "capabilities": parameters,
        "system_prompt": system_prompt.strip(),
        "temperature": temperature
    }

data = parse_model_info("model.info.txt")
print(data)
```

This function reads the data from the file, splits it into sections and then parses each line according to its section. The parsed data is returned as a dictionary with three keys: variables (for model parameters), capabilities (for capability keywords) and system_prompt (the content of System section). 

Please ensure that your `model.info.txt` file is in the same directory where you're running this script or specify the full path to the file.
