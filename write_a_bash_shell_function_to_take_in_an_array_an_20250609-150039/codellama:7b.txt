```
#!/bin/bash

function list_array {
  local -n arr=$1 # reference to the array passed as argument
  printf "<ul>\n"
  for i in "${arr[@]}"; do
    printf "<li>%s</li>\n" "$i"
  done
  printf "</ul>\n"
}
```
This function takes an array as its first argument, and uses the `${varname[@]}` syntax to iterate over its elements. The `local -n` option tells Bash to create a reference to the variable named `arr`, which is passed as an argument to the function. The `printf` statement is used to generate the HTML list output.

You can use this function in your script by calling it with the name of the array you want to convert to a list, like this:
```
my_array=("apple" "banana" "cherry")
list_array my_array
```
This will output a HTML list containing the elements of the `my_array` array.
