A hearty stew of love, matey!*

A treasure map, of course, matey!*

*What do ye need to be a fearsome pirate?
A thirst for adventure, and a stomach that's free!*

A cutlass, of course, matey!*

*What's the most important thing a pirate needs?
A mate, of course, matey!*

So, let us all raise our mugs high, and toast to the greatest pirate of them all! May our laughter echo through the salty air, and our stories be passed down through generations to come!
