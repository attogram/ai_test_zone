To parse the stats and show.txt files, we can use bash scripting along with some parsing techniques. Here's an example of how you can approach this task:

1. Read in and parse the stats file (stats.txt).

   a. Save the data into bash variables.
   b. Each line is in the format "name: value". Parse the file so that each line has a name ("total duration", etc.) and a value ("4.687657458s", etc.).
   c. Example of parsing the stats.txt file:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    while IFS= read -r line; do
        name="${line%% *}"
        value="${line##* }"
        echo "Name: $name, Value: $value"
    done < stats.txt
    ```

2. Read in and parse the show.txt file (show.txt)).

   a. Save the data into bash variables.
   b. There are three sections: Model, Capabilities, and Parameters. Parse each section separately.
   c. For the Model Section, it's in the format "name   value". Example of parsing the show.txt file for this section:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    section="Model"
    echo "Parsing $section section..."
    while IFS= read -r line; do
        if [[ "$line" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+:[ ]*[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$ ]]; then
            name="${line%% *}"
            value="${line##* }"
            echo "Name: $name, Value: $value"
        fi
    done < show.txt
    ```

3. Save the data into bash variables.
4. Parse the file so that each line has a name ("total duration", etc.) and a value ("4.687657458s", etc.).
5. Display the parsed information for each section (Model, Capabilities, Parameters).

   a. Example of parsing the show.txt file for each section:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    parse_file() {
        section="$1"
        echo "Parsing $section section..."
        while IFS= read -r line; do
            if [[ "$line" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+:[ ]*[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$ ]]; then
                name="${line%% *}"
                value="${line##* }"
                echo "Name: $name, Value: $value"
            fi
        done < "$2"
    }

    # Parse the Model section
    parse_file "Model" show.txt
    unset parse_file

    # Parse the Capabilities section
    parse_file "Capabilities" show.txt
    unset parse_file

    # Parse the Parameters section
    parse_file "Parameters" show.txt
    unset parse_file
    ```

This script will read in and parse both the stats.txt and show.txt files. The parsed information for each section will be displayed.
