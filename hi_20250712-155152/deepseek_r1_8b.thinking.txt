Okay, the user just said "hi" in a very simple and minimal way. 

Hmm, this is probably just an opening greeting rather than a complex query or statement. The tone seems neutral - maybe they're testing how I respond to basic messages? Or perhaps they're genuinely initiating contact but not sure what to ask yet.

Given the simplicity of the message, I should keep my response equally simple and friendly while leaving room for them to steer the conversation in any direction they want. No need to overcomplicate it - just acknowledge their greeting warmly and invite further interaction.

The user might be:
- A new visitor checking if the assistant works
- Someone who wants quick help but didn't specify what yet
- Just starting a casual chat

I'll respond with basic politeness since I don't have context about their needs or identity. Keeping it warm but neutral is probably safest here - they can reveal more information as we continue talking.
