Okay, the user said "hi /think". I need to respond appropriately. Let me start by acknowledging their greeting. Since they included "/think", maybe they're testing if I can process that command. I should confirm that I received their message and offer assistance. Keep it friendly and open-ended. Let me make sure the response is welcoming and invites them to ask questions. Alright, that should cover it.
