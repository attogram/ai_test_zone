Okay, the user just said "hi". I need to respond appropriately. Since they didn't ask a question, I should greet them back and offer assistance. Maybe start with a friendly greeting, then ask how I can help them today. Keep it simple and open-ended so they feel comfortable to share what they need. Avoid any technical jargon or assumptions. Just a standard welcome message.
