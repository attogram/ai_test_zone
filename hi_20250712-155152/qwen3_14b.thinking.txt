Okay, the user said "hi". I need to respond appropriately. Let me think about the best way to greet them. Maybe start with a friendly greeting like "Hello!" and ask how I can assist them. That should be welcoming and open-ended. Let me check if there's anything else I should add. No, that's probably enough for now. Just keep it simple and polite.
