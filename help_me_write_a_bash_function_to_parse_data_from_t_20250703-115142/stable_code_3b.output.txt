Here is a Bash function that can parse data from the `model.info.txt` file:
```bash
parse_model_info() {
  # Read lines from model.info.txt file
  local filename="$1"
  while IFS= read -r line; do
    # Parse each line in Model section
    if [[ $line == "Model"* ]]; then
      declare -A model
      read -r line
      while [[ $line != *"="* && $line != ""* ]]; do
        model["${line%%*=*}"]="${line#*=}"
        read -r line
      done
      echo "Model:"
      for key in "${!model[@]}"; do
        echo "${model[$key]]}"
      done
    fi
  done < "$filename"
}
```
To use this function, simply call it with the path to your `model.info.txt` file as an argument:
```bash
parse_model_info /path/to/model.info.txt
```
This will print out all of the information that was parsed from the `model.info.txt` file.
