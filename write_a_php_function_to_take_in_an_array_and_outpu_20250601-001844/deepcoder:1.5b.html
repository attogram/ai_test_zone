Okay, I need to write a PHP function that takes an array and outputs a HTML list of its contents. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should consider how HTML lists are structured. Each item in the array should be placed within `&lt;li&gt;` tags. So for each element in the input array, I&#39;ll create a &lt;li&gt; element.

Next, I need to handle different data types in the array. For example, if an element is a string, it should just appear as text inside the list. If it&#39;s an integer or float, converting it to a string will display correctly. Booleans should also be converted to their boolean values, which when cast to strings become &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;.

I&#39;ll loop through each key-value pair in the array. For each value, I&#39;ll check its type. Wait, actually, since arrays in PHP don&#39;t have ordered keys, but the input is an array, so perhaps it&#39;s better to iterate using values() or maybe just use a foreach loop with keys. Hmm, maybe using a simple for loop and accessing each key.

Wait, no. In PHP, when you pass an array to a function, each element has a unique key. So perhaps iterating over the keys would be necessary. But in this case, since it&#39;s an array of values, perhaps just looping through each value as they come into the function.

Alternatively, maybe using a foreach loop with array_keys. Let me think: for ($key =&gt; $value in $array) { ... }

Yes, that makes sense. So I&#39;ll use a foreach loop over each key-value pair.

For each value, I&#39;ll process it to create a string. The processing steps would be:

1. Check if the value is already a string. If not, convert it to a string.
2. Handle booleans: true becomes &#39;true&#39;, false becomes &#39;false&#39;.
3. For other data types like integers, floats, etc., just cast to string.

Wait, but in PHP, when you pass an array to this function, each element is either a scalar or an object. So for each value, I&#39;ll check its type and convert appropriately.

Let me outline the steps:

- Initialize an empty array to hold each list item.
- Loop through each key-value pair in the input array.
- For each value:
   - If it&#39;s already a string, add it as is.
   - Else, if it&#39;s a boolean, convert to &#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39;.
   - Else, cast to string.
- Append each processed value to the corresponding &lt;li&gt; tag.

Wait, but in PHP, how do I handle different data types when converting? For example:

- If $value is integer 123, it should become &quot;123&quot;.
- If $value is float 45.67, it becomes &quot;45.67&quot;.
- If $value is array, perhaps we treat it as a single element and convert to string, but maybe that&#39;s beyond the current problem. The question says &quot;array&quot; so perhaps just handle scalar values.

So in code:

foreach ($inputArray as $key =&gt; $value) {
    // process $value
    if (is_string($value)) {
        $str = $value;
    } else {
        if (is_bool($value)) {
            $str = $value ? &#39;true&#39; : &#39;false&#39;;
        } elseif (is_int($value)) {
            $str = (string)$value;
        } elseif (is_float($value)) {
            // maybe round or something, but perhaps just cast
            $str = (string)round($value);
        } else {
            // assume it&#39;s a scalar that can be converted to string
            $str = (string)$value;
        }
    }

    // Wait, perhaps better to use a helper function.
    // Alternatively, let&#39;s handle each case.

    // Another approach: check if it&#39;s already a string. If not, see what type it is and convert accordingly.

    // Maybe using strval except for booleans?
    $str = (is_string($value) ? $value : (is_bool($value) ? $value : (float)($value) ?? (string)$value));

    Wait, perhaps a better way. Let&#39;s think about all possible values:

    For each value, convert it to string as follows:

    - If it&#39;s already a string, use it.
    - Else, if it&#39;s a boolean, convert to &#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39;.
    - Else, cast to string.

    So code inside the loop:

    $str = is_string($value) ? $value : (bool)$value ? &#39;true&#39; : (string)$value;

    Wait, no. Because for booleans, it&#39;s better to check if it&#39;s a boolean and then return &#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39;, else convert to string.

    So perhaps:

    if (is_string($value)) {
        $str = $value;
    } elseif (is_bool($value)) {
        $str = $value ? &#39;true&#39; : &#39;false&#39;;
    } elseif (is_numeric($value)) {
        // handle numeric types
        try {
            $str = (string)$value;
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
            // maybe for objects, but perhaps beyond the scope.
            // Alternatively, just cast to string?
            $str = (string)$value;
        }
    } else {
        // assuming it&#39;s a scalar that can be converted
        $str = (string)$value;
    }

    Wait, this might get complicated. Maybe using a helper function.

    Alternatively, perhaps use the following logic for each value:

    - If the value is already a string, leave as is.
    - Else if it&#39;s a boolean, convert to &#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39;.
    - Else, cast to string.

    So in code:

    foreach ($inputArray as $key =&gt; $value) {
        // process each value
        if (is_string($value)) {
            list_str = $str;
        } else {
            if (is_bool($value)) {
                $str = $value ? &#39;true&#39; : &#39;false&#39;;
            } elseif (is_int($value)) {
                $str = (string)$value;
            } elseif (is_float($value)) {
                // perhaps round to avoid decimal points?
                $str = (string)round($value);
            } else {
                $str = (string)$value;
            }
        }

        // Wait, this approach might not handle all cases. Maybe a better way is to try converting each value to string and see.

        // Another idea: use the strval function but check if it&#39;s boolean or string already.

        // Perhaps another approach: create an array where each element is wrapped in &lt;li&gt; tags, then join them with &lt;br&gt;?

        Wait, perhaps a better way. Let&#39;s think about how to generate each list item.

        For each value in the input array:

        - If it&#39;s a string, add &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; . $value . &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;.
        - Else if it&#39;s true or false, add &quot;&lt;li&gt;!&quot; . ($value ? &#39;true&#39; : &#39;false&#39;) . &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;.
        - Else, convert to string and add &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; . (string)$value . &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;.

        Wait, perhaps that&#39;s overcomplicating. Let&#39;s think about the initial approach: loop through each value, process it into a string, then wrap in &lt;li&gt; tags.

        So for example:

        For $input = [1 =&gt; &quot;one&quot;, 2 =&gt; &quot;two&quot;];

        The output should be:

        &lt;li&gt;one&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;two&lt;/li&gt;

        Wait no, because the array is probably like [0 =&gt; &#39;apple&#39;, 1 =&gt; &#39;banana&#39;], then it would create two list items.

        So perhaps in code:

        $html = [];
        foreach ($inputArray as $key =&gt; $value) {
            // process value into string
            if (is_string($value)) {
                $str = $value;
            } elseif (is_bool($value)) {
                $str = (bool)$value ? &#39;true&#39; : &#39;false&#39;;
            } else {
                $str = (string)$value;
            }
            $html[] = &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; . $str . &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;;
        }

        Wait, but what about when the value is null? Because in PHP, null can&#39;t be cast to string. So perhaps we need to handle that case as well.

        For example:

        If $value is null, then (string)$value would be &#39;null&#39; which might not be desired. But according to the problem statement, it&#39;s an array of values, so perhaps nulls should be converted appropriately.

        Alternatively, perhaps let&#39;s assume that all elements are either strings or booleans or numbers.

        So putting it all together:

        The function will take each element in the input array, process it into a string according to the rules, and then wrap each processed string in &lt;li&gt; tags. Then join all these list items with &lt;br&gt;?

        Wait, no. Because if the input is an array like [1 =&gt; &#39;one&#39;, 2 =&gt; &#39;two&#39;], then we need two &lt;li&gt; elements.

        So perhaps:

        $html = [];
        foreach ($inputArray as $key =&gt; $value) {
            // process value into string
            if (is_string($value)) {
                $str = $value;
            } elseif (is_bool($value)) {
                $str = $value ? &#39;true&#39; : &#39;false&#39;;
            } else {
                $str = (string)$value;
            }
            $html[] = &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; . $str . &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;;
        }

        Then, join all the list items with &lt;br&gt; in between.

        Wait, but for example:

        Input: [1 =&gt; &quot;one&quot;, 2 =&gt; &quot;two&quot;]

        The output should be:

        &lt;li&gt;one&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;two&lt;/li&gt;

        So perhaps if there are multiple elements, each is a separate list item. So the function returns all these as an array of HTML lists.

        Now, let&#39;s think about cases where some values are not strings or booleans but other types like integers, floats, etc.

        For example:

        Input: [0 =&gt; 1, 1 =&gt; &quot;two&quot;, &#39;a&#39; =&gt; true]

        The output should be:

        &lt;li&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;two&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;true&lt;/li&gt;

        So perhaps the code will handle each value as follows:

        For $value = 1: (string)1 is &quot;1&quot;
        For $value = &#39;a&#39;: it&#39;s a string, so use as is.
        Wait no. Because if $value is a string, we don&#39;t want to treat it as boolean or anything else.

        Wait, perhaps the initial code I thought of may have issues because for example:

        If $value is an integer 10, then (string)$value is &quot;10&quot;, which is correct.

        So let&#39;s proceed with writing the function step by step.

        The function will take an array as input. For each element in the array, process it into a string as follows:

        - If it&#39;s already a string, use it.
        - Else if it&#39;s a boolean, convert to &#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39;.
        - Else, cast to string.

        So code inside the loop:

        foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $value) {
            if (is_string($value)) {
                $str = $value;
            } elseif (is_bool($value)) {
                $str = $value ? &#39;true&#39; : &#39;false&#39;;
            } else {
                // Assume it&#39;s a number or other type
                try {
                    $str = (string)$value;
                } catch (\Throwable $e) {
                    // handle error, maybe convert to empty string?
                    $str = &#39;&#39;;
                }
            }

            $html_element = &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; . $str . &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;;
            array_push($html_array, $html_element);
        }

        Then, return $html_array.

        Wait, but what about when the value is null? Because (string)null would be &#39;null&#39;, which may not be desired. For example:

        If input is [null =&gt; &#39;something&#39;], then it should be converted to a string correctly?

        Alternatively, perhaps let&#39;s just cast all non-string values to strings, and handle booleans as well.

        Let me think about another approach: create an array where each element is wrapped in &lt;li&gt; tags. So for each value:

        - If it&#39;s already a string, wrap it.
        - Else if it&#39;s boolean, wrap &#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39;.
        - Else, cast to string and wrap.

        Now, writing this code step by step.

        First, create an empty array $html.

        Then, loop through each key-value pair in the input array.

        For each value:

            check if it is a string. If yes, add as is inside &lt;li&gt; tags.

            else if it&#39;s a boolean: convert to &#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39;.

            else: cast to string and wrap.

        Wait, perhaps more accurately:

        $html = array();

        foreach ($inputArray as $key =&gt; $value) {

            // process each value
            if (is_string($value)) {
                $str = $value;
            } elseif (is_bool($value)) {
                $str = $value ? &#39;true&#39; : &#39;false&#39;;
            } else {
                try {
                    $str = (string)$value;
                } catch (\Throwable $e) {
                    // perhaps handle error, but maybe just return empty string?
                    $str = &#39;&#39;;
                }
            }

            $html_element = &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; . $str . &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;;
            array_push($html, $html_element);

        }

        Wait, but in the case where $value is null:

        For example, if input is [null =&gt; &#39;something&#39;], then (string)null would be &#39;null&#39;, which may not be intended. But perhaps since null is treated as a string in HTML lists.

        Alternatively, maybe let&#39;s see what happens with this approach.

        Let&#39;s take an example where the array is:

        $array = [
            0 =&gt; &quot;zero&quot;,
            1 =&gt; &quot;one&quot;,
            &#39;a&#39; =&gt; true
        ]

        Then the output should be:

        &lt;li&gt;zero&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;one&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;true&lt;/li&gt;

        Which seems correct.

        Now, what about if a value is an integer like 5?

        It would become &quot;5&quot;, which is fine.

        What about if it&#39;s a float like 3.14? Then (string)3.14 becomes &quot;3.14&quot;.

        So that should be acceptable.

        Now, another test case: array with objects or arrays as values. Wait, perhaps the problem expects only scalar values in the array. Because otherwise, converting an object to a string may not give meaningful results.

        For example, if $array has [new stdClass() =&gt; &#39;something&#39;], then (string) would be something like &quot;Object&quot; which might not be intended. But without more context, maybe it&#39;s beyond the scope of this problem and we can assume that all values are scalar or booleans.

        Now, putting it all together into code:

        The function will loop through each element in $inputArray, process each value as per above logic, create a &lt;li&gt; tag for each processed string, collect them into an array, and return that array.

        So the PHP function would look like this:

        Function takes $array as parameter.

        Initialize an empty array $html.

        Loop over each key =&gt; value in $array.

            process value to get $str.

            create a &lt;li&gt; tag with $str.

            add to $html.

        Return $html.

        Now, let&#39;s code this step by step.

        First, define the function:

        function html_array($inputArray) {

            $html = array();

            foreach ($inputArray as $key =&gt; $value) {

                // process value
                if (is_string($value)) {
                    $str = $value;
                } elseif (is_bool($value)) {
                    $str = $value ? &#39;true&#39; : &#39;false&#39;;
                } else {
                    try {
                        $str = (string)$value;
                    } catch (\Throwable $e) {
                        // if conversion fails, default to empty string?
                        $str = &#39;&#39;;
                    }
                }

                // create the li element
                $html_element = &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; . $str . &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;;
                array_push($html, $html_element);

            }

            return $html;

        }

        Wait, but in PHP, when using try-catch for converting to string, perhaps it&#39;s better to handle cases where $value is not a boolean or string.

        Alternatively, let me think about the else clause:

        For example, if $value is an integer 123, casting to string is &#39;123&#39;.

        If $value is null, then (string)null would be &#39;null&#39;, which may not be desired. But perhaps in this problem&#39;s context, it&#39;s acceptable.

        Now, let&#39;s test the function with a sample input:

        Sample Input: [0 =&gt; &quot;one&quot;, 1 =&gt; &quot;two&quot;]

        Output should be:

        [
            &lt;li&gt;one&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;two&lt;/li&gt;
        ]

        Let&#39;s see how the code handles it.

        For each key-value pair:

        - 0 =&gt; &quot;one&quot;: is string, so $str = &quot;one&quot;. So element is &quot;&lt;li&gt;one&lt;/li&gt;&quot;.
        - 1 =&gt; &quot;two&quot;: same as above. So two elements are added.

        The function returns an array with these two elements.

        Another test case: [1 =&gt; &quot;one&quot;, true =&gt; &quot;true&quot;]

        Output:

        &lt;li&gt;one&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;true&lt;/li&gt;

        Which is correct.

        Now, what about when $value is null?

        For example, input is [null =&gt; &#39;something&#39;].

        Then $str would be (string)null which is &#39;null&#39;, but perhaps the intended output should have it as &quot;null&quot; or maybe treat null differently. But since the problem statement doesn&#39;t specify this case, I&#39;ll proceed with what&#39;s written.

        Now, think about when $value is an array:

        For example, [ [&#39;a&#39; =&gt; 1], false ]

        Then for &#39;a&#39; =&gt; 1: it&#39;s a boolean? No. So (string)1 would be &quot;1&quot;.

        Wait no: the value here is actually an integer or maybe another type.

        Wait, perhaps to make sure that all values are correctly converted:

        Let me think about writing unit tests in code if possible, but since I can&#39;t do that now, let&#39;s proceed with what seems correct.

        So overall, this function should handle converting each value into a string and wrap it in &lt;li&gt; tags.
&lt;/think&gt;

To solve this problem, we need to write a PHP function that takes an array and outputs a HTML list of the array contents. Each element from the array should be wrapped inside `&lt;li&gt;` tags.

### Approach
1. **Initialize an empty array**: This will hold all the HTML list elements.
2. **Loop through each key-value pair in the input array**:
   - Check if the value is a string, boolean, or another type.
   - Convert the value to a string according to specific rules (e.g., booleans are converted to &#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39;, strings remain unchanged).
3. **Create HTML elements**: For each processed value, wrap it in `&lt;li&gt;` tags and add it to the result array.
4. **Return the result array**: The function returns an array where each element is a `&lt;li&gt;` tag containing the corresponding HTML content.

### Solution Code
```php
function html_array($inputArray) {
    $html = array();
    foreach ($inputArray as $key =&gt; $value) {
        if (is_string($value)) {
            $str = $value;
        } elseif (is_bool($value)) {
            $str = $value ? &#39;true&#39; : &#39;false&#39;;
        } else {
            try {
                $str = (string)$value;
            } catch (\Throwable $e) {
                $str = &#39;&#39;;
            }
        }

        $html_element = &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; . $str . &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;;
        array_push($html, $html_element);
    }

    return $html;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing an empty array `$html` to store the HTML elements.
- **Loop Through Array**: For each key-value pair in the input array:
  - If the value is a string, it is directly used as is.
  - If the value is a boolean, it is converted to &#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39;.
  - For other types, it is converted to a string using `(string)$value`, handling any potential conversion errors by defaulting to an empty string if necessary.
- **HTML Element Creation**: Each processed value is wrapped in `&lt;li&gt;` tags and added to the `$html` array.
- **Return Result**: The function returns the `$html` array containing all the HTML elements.

This approach ensures that each element from the input array is correctly converted into a string and properly formatted as an HTML list.</textarea>
