<think>
Okay, I need to write a PHP function that takes an array and outputs a HTML list of its contents. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should consider how HTML lists are structured. Each item in the array should be placed within `<li>` tags. So for each element in the input array, I'll create a <li> element.

Next, I need to handle different data types in the array. For example, if an element is a string, it should just appear as text inside the list. If it's an integer or float, converting it to a string will display correctly. Booleans should also be converted to their boolean values, which when cast to strings become "true" and "false".

I'll loop through each key-value pair in the array. For each value, I'll check its type. Wait, actually, since arrays in PHP don't have ordered keys, but the input is an array, so perhaps it's better to iterate using values() or maybe just use a foreach loop with keys. Hmm, maybe using a simple for loop and accessing each key.

Wait, no. In PHP, when you pass an array to a function, each element has a unique key. So perhaps iterating over the keys would be necessary. But in this case, since it's an array of values, perhaps just looping through each value as they come into the function.

Alternatively, maybe using a foreach loop with array_keys. Let me think: for ($key => $value in $array) { ... }

Yes, that makes sense. So I'll use a foreach loop over each key-value pair.

For each value, I'll process it to create a string. The processing steps would be:

1. Check if the value is already a string. If not, convert it to a string.
2. Handle booleans: true becomes 'true', false becomes 'false'.
3. For other data types like integers, floats, etc., just cast to string.

Wait, but in PHP, when you pass an array to this function, each element is either a scalar or an object. So for each value, I'll check its type and convert appropriately.

Let me outline the steps:

- Initialize an empty array to hold each list item.
- Loop through each key-value pair in the input array.
- For each value:
   - If it's already a string, add it as is.
   - Else, if it's a boolean, convert to 'true' or 'false'.
   - Else, cast to string.
- Append each processed value to the corresponding <li> tag.

Wait, but in PHP, how do I handle different data types when converting? For example:

- If $value is integer 123, it should become "123".
- If $value is float 45.67, it becomes "45.67".
- If $value is array, perhaps we treat it as a single element and convert to string, but maybe that's beyond the current problem. The question says "array" so perhaps just handle scalar values.

So in code:

foreach ($inputArray as $key => $value) {
    // process $value
    if (is_string($value)) {
        $str = $value;
    } else {
        if (is_bool($value)) {
            $str = $value ? 'true' : 'false';
        } elseif (is_int($value)) {
            $str = (string)$value;
        } elseif (is_float($value)) {
            // maybe round or something, but perhaps just cast
            $str = (string)round($value);
        } else {
            // assume it's a scalar that can be converted to string
            $str = (string)$value;
        }
    }

    // Wait, perhaps better to use a helper function.
    // Alternatively, let's handle each case.

    // Another approach: check if it's already a string. If not, see what type it is and convert accordingly.

    // Maybe using strval except for booleans?
    $str = (is_string($value) ? $value : (is_bool($value) ? $value : (float)($value) ?? (string)$value));

    Wait, perhaps a better way. Let's think about all possible values:

    For each value, convert it to string as follows:

    - If it's already a string, use it.
    - Else, if it's a boolean, convert to 'true' or 'false'.
    - Else, cast to string.

    So code inside the loop:

    $str = is_string($value) ? $value : (bool)$value ? 'true' : (string)$value;

    Wait, no. Because for booleans, it's better to check if it's a boolean and then return 'true' or 'false', else convert to string.

    So perhaps:

    if (is_string($value)) {
        $str = $value;
    } elseif (is_bool($value)) {
        $str = $value ? 'true' : 'false';
    } elseif (is_numeric($value)) {
        // handle numeric types
        try {
            $str = (string)$value;
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
            // maybe for objects, but perhaps beyond the scope.
            // Alternatively, just cast to string?
            $str = (string)$value;
        }
    } else {
        // assuming it's a scalar that can be converted
        $str = (string)$value;
    }

    Wait, this might get complicated. Maybe using a helper function.

    Alternatively, perhaps use the following logic for each value:

    - If the value is already a string, leave as is.
    - Else if it's a boolean, convert to 'true' or 'false'.
    - Else, cast to string.

    So in code:

    foreach ($inputArray as $key => $value) {
        // process each value
        if (is_string($value)) {
            list_str = $str;
        } else {
            if (is_bool($value)) {
                $str = $value ? 'true' : 'false';
            } elseif (is_int($value)) {
                $str = (string)$value;
            } elseif (is_float($value)) {
                // perhaps round to avoid decimal points?
                $str = (string)round($value);
            } else {
                $str = (string)$value;
            }
        }

        // Wait, this approach might not handle all cases. Maybe a better way is to try converting each value to string and see.

        // Another idea: use the strval function but check if it's boolean or string already.

        // Perhaps another approach: create an array where each element is wrapped in <li> tags, then join them with <br>?

        Wait, perhaps a better way. Let's think about how to generate each list item.

        For each value in the input array:

        - If it's a string, add "<li>" . $value . "</li>".
        - Else if it's true or false, add "<li>!" . ($value ? 'true' : 'false') . "</li>".
        - Else, convert to string and add "<li>" . (string)$value . "</li>".

        Wait, perhaps that's overcomplicating. Let's think about the initial approach: loop through each value, process it into a string, then wrap in <li> tags.

        So for example:

        For $input = [1 => "one", 2 => "two"];

        The output should be:

        <li>one</li>
        <li>two</li>

        Wait no, because the array is probably like [0 => 'apple', 1 => 'banana'], then it would create two list items.

        So perhaps in code:

        $html = [];
        foreach ($inputArray as $key => $value) {
            // process value into string
            if (is_string($value)) {
                $str = $value;
            } elseif (is_bool($value)) {
                $str = (bool)$value ? 'true' : 'false';
            } else {
                $str = (string)$value;
            }
            $html[] = "<li>" . $str . "</li>";
        }

        Wait, but what about when the value is null? Because in PHP, null can't be cast to string. So perhaps we need to handle that case as well.

        For example:

        If $value is null, then (string)$value would be 'null' which might not be desired. But according to the problem statement, it's an array of values, so perhaps nulls should be converted appropriately.

        Alternatively, perhaps let's assume that all elements are either strings or booleans or numbers.

        So putting it all together:

        The function will take each element in the input array, process it into a string according to the rules, and then wrap each processed string in <li> tags. Then join all these list items with <br>?

        Wait, no. Because if the input is an array like [1 => 'one', 2 => 'two'], then we need two <li> elements.

        So perhaps:

        $html = [];
        foreach ($inputArray as $key => $value) {
            // process value into string
            if (is_string($value)) {
                $str = $value;
            } elseif (is_bool($value)) {
                $str = $value ? 'true' : 'false';
            } else {
                $str = (string)$value;
            }
            $html[] = "<li>" . $str . "</li>";
        }

        Then, join all the list items with <br> in between.

        Wait, but for example:

        Input: [1 => "one", 2 => "two"]

        The output should be:

        <li>one</li>
        <li>two</li>

        So perhaps if there are multiple elements, each is a separate list item. So the function returns all these as an array of HTML lists.

        Now, let's think about cases where some values are not strings or booleans but other types like integers, floats, etc.

        For example:

        Input: [0 => 1, 1 => "two", 'a' => true]

        The output should be:

        <li>1</li>
        <li>two</li>
        <li>true</li>

        So perhaps the code will handle each value as follows:

        For $value = 1: (string)1 is "1"
        For $value = 'a': it's a string, so use as is.
        Wait no. Because if $value is a string, we don't want to treat it as boolean or anything else.

        Wait, perhaps the initial code I thought of may have issues because for example:

        If $value is an integer 10, then (string)$value is "10", which is correct.

        So let's proceed with writing the function step by step.

        The function will take an array as input. For each element in the array, process it into a string as follows:

        - If it's already a string, use it.
        - Else if it's a boolean, convert to 'true' or 'false'.
        - Else, cast to string.

        So code inside the loop:

        foreach ($array as $key => $value) {
            if (is_string($value)) {
                $str = $value;
            } elseif (is_bool($value)) {
                $str = $value ? 'true' : 'false';
            } else {
                // Assume it's a number or other type
                try {
                    $str = (string)$value;
                } catch (\Throwable $e) {
                    // handle error, maybe convert to empty string?
                    $str = '';
                }
            }

            $html_element = "<li>" . $str . "</li>";
            array_push($html_array, $html_element);
        }

        Then, return $html_array.

        Wait, but what about when the value is null? Because (string)null would be 'null', which may not be desired. For example:

        If input is [null => 'something'], then it should be converted to a string correctly?

        Alternatively, perhaps let's just cast all non-string values to strings, and handle booleans as well.

        Let me think about another approach: create an array where each element is wrapped in <li> tags. So for each value:

        - If it's already a string, wrap it.
        - Else if it's boolean, wrap 'true' or 'false'.
        - Else, cast to string and wrap.

        Now, writing this code step by step.

        First, create an empty array $html.

        Then, loop through each key-value pair in the input array.

        For each value:

            check if it is a string. If yes, add as is inside <li> tags.

            else if it's a boolean: convert to 'true' or 'false'.

            else: cast to string and wrap.

        Wait, perhaps more accurately:

        $html = array();

        foreach ($inputArray as $key => $value) {

            // process each value
            if (is_string($value)) {
                $str = $value;
            } elseif (is_bool($value)) {
                $str = $value ? 'true' : 'false';
            } else {
                try {
                    $str = (string)$value;
                } catch (\Throwable $e) {
                    // perhaps handle error, but maybe just return empty string?
                    $str = '';
                }
            }

            $html_element = "<li>" . $str . "</li>";
            array_push($html, $html_element);

        }

        Wait, but in the case where $value is null:

        For example, if input is [null => 'something'], then (string)null would be 'null', which may not be intended. But perhaps since null is treated as a string in HTML lists.

        Alternatively, maybe let's see what happens with this approach.

        Let's take an example where the array is:

        $array = [
            0 => "zero",
            1 => "one",
            'a' => true
        ]

        Then the output should be:

        <li>zero</li>
        <li>one</li>
        <li>true</li>

        Which seems correct.

        Now, what about if a value is an integer like 5?

        It would become "5", which is fine.

        What about if it's a float like 3.14? Then (string)3.14 becomes "3.14".

        So that should be acceptable.

        Now, another test case: array with objects or arrays as values. Wait, perhaps the problem expects only scalar values in the array. Because otherwise, converting an object to a string may not give meaningful results.

        For example, if $array has [new stdClass() => 'something'], then (string) would be something like "Object" which might not be intended. But without more context, maybe it's beyond the scope of this problem and we can assume that all values are scalar or booleans.

        Now, putting it all together into code:

        The function will loop through each element in $inputArray, process each value as per above logic, create a <li> tag for each processed string, collect them into an array, and return that array.

        So the PHP function would look like this:

        Function takes $array as parameter.

        Initialize an empty array $html.

        Loop over each key => value in $array.

            process value to get $str.

            create a <li> tag with $str.

            add to $html.

        Return $html.

        Now, let's code this step by step.

        First, define the function:

        function html_array($inputArray) {

            $html = array();

            foreach ($inputArray as $key => $value) {

                // process value
                if (is_string($value)) {
                    $str = $value;
                } elseif (is_bool($value)) {
                    $str = $value ? 'true' : 'false';
                } else {
                    try {
                        $str = (string)$value;
                    } catch (\Throwable $e) {
                        // if conversion fails, default to empty string?
                        $str = '';
                    }
                }

                // create the li element
                $html_element = "<li>" . $str . "</li>";
                array_push($html, $html_element);

            }

            return $html;

        }

        Wait, but in PHP, when using try-catch for converting to string, perhaps it's better to handle cases where $value is not a boolean or string.

        Alternatively, let me think about the else clause:

        For example, if $value is an integer 123, casting to string is '123'.

        If $value is null, then (string)null would be 'null', which may not be desired. But perhaps in this problem's context, it's acceptable.

        Now, let's test the function with a sample input:

        Sample Input: [0 => "one", 1 => "two"]

        Output should be:

        [
            <li>one</li>
            <li>two</li>
        ]

        Let's see how the code handles it.

        For each key-value pair:

        - 0 => "one": is string, so $str = "one". So element is "<li>one</li>".
        - 1 => "two": same as above. So two elements are added.

        The function returns an array with these two elements.

        Another test case: [1 => "one", true => "true"]

        Output:

        <li>one</li>
        <li>true</li>

        Which is correct.

        Now, what about when $value is null?

        For example, input is [null => 'something'].

        Then $str would be (string)null which is 'null', but perhaps the intended output should have it as "null" or maybe treat null differently. But since the problem statement doesn't specify this case, I'll proceed with what's written.

        Now, think about when $value is an array:

        For example, [ ['a' => 1], false ]

        Then for 'a' => 1: it's a boolean? No. So (string)1 would be "1".

        Wait no: the value here is actually an integer or maybe another type.

        Wait, perhaps to make sure that all values are correctly converted:

        Let me think about writing unit tests in code if possible, but since I can't do that now, let's proceed with what seems correct.

        So overall, this function should handle converting each value into a string and wrap it in <li> tags.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to write a PHP function that takes an array and outputs a HTML list of the array contents. Each element from the array should be wrapped inside `<li>` tags.

### Approach
1. **Initialize an empty array**: This will hold all the HTML list elements.
2. **Loop through each key-value pair in the input array**:
   - Check if the value is a string, boolean, or another type.
   - Convert the value to a string according to specific rules (e.g., booleans are converted to 'true' or 'false', strings remain unchanged).
3. **Create HTML elements**: For each processed value, wrap it in `<li>` tags and add it to the result array.
4. **Return the result array**: The function returns an array where each element is a `<li>` tag containing the corresponding HTML content.

### Solution Code
```php
function html_array($inputArray) {
    $html = array();
    foreach ($inputArray as $key => $value) {
        if (is_string($value)) {
            $str = $value;
        } elseif (is_bool($value)) {
            $str = $value ? 'true' : 'false';
        } else {
            try {
                $str = (string)$value;
            } catch (\Throwable $e) {
                $str = '';
            }
        }

        $html_element = "<li>" . $str . "</li>";
        array_push($html, $html_element);
    }

    return $html;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing an empty array `$html` to store the HTML elements.
- **Loop Through Array**: For each key-value pair in the input array:
  - If the value is a string, it is directly used as is.
  - If the value is a boolean, it is converted to 'true' or 'false'.
  - For other types, it is converted to a string using `(string)$value`, handling any potential conversion errors by defaulting to an empty string if necessary.
- **HTML Element Creation**: Each processed value is wrapped in `<li>` tags and added to the `$html` array.
- **Return Result**: The function returns the `$html` array containing all the HTML elements.

This approach ensures that each element from the input array is correctly converted into a string and properly formatted as an HTML list.
