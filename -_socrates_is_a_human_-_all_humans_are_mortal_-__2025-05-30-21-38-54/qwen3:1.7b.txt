Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Socrates is mortal based on the given premises. So the premises are: Socrates is a human, and all humans are mortal. The question is whether Socrates is mortal.

First, I need to recall some basic logic here. If all humans are mortal, then any human must be mortal. Since Socrates is a human, then by the first premise, he's a human. So applying the second premise, which states that all humans are mortal, Socrates should be mortal. That seems straightforward.

But wait, maybe there's a trick here. Like, are there any exceptions? The premises don't mention any exceptions. They just say all humans are mortal. So if Socrates is a human, then he must be mortal. There's no mention of Socrates being immortal or any other conditions. So logically, the conclusion should follow.

But maybe the user is testing if I know that in formal logic, if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must be true. So here, P is "Socrates is a human" and Q is "Socrates is mortal." Since all humans are mortal (which is a general statement), then if Socrates is a human, he must be mortal. So yes, the answer should be yes.

I should also consider if there's any possible way the premises could contradict each other. But the premises are given as true, so there's no contradiction. Therefore, the conclusion is valid.

Based on the given premises:

1. **Socrates is a human**  
2. **All humans are mortal**  

Logical reasoning applies here:  
- If all humans are mortal (Premise 2), and Socrates is a human (Premise 1), then **Socrates must be mortal** (by modus ponens).  

There are no exceptions or conflicting premises provided. Thus, the conclusion follows directly from the premises.  

**Answer:** Yes, Socrates is mortal.
