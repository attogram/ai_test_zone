        <h2>What are the Northern Lights?</h2>
        <p>The Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis, are natural light displays that occur in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions around the Arctic and Antarctic. These dazzling lights are caused by charged particles from the Sun interacting with Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere.</p>

        <h2>Colors of the Northern Lights</h2>
        <p>The Northern Lights can appear in a variety of colors, including green, pink, red, yellow, and blue. The most common color is green, caused by oxygen molecules approximately 60 miles above the Earth. Other colors are caused by interactions with other molecules, such as nitrogen.</p>

        <h2>Best Places to See Them</h2>
        <p>To experience the Northern Lights, visit locations near the Arctic Circle. Some of the best places include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Norway (Troms√∏)</li>
            <li>Sweden (Abisko National Park)</li>
            <li>Iceland (Thingvellir National Park)</li>
            <li>Finland (Lapland)</li>
            <li>Canada (Yukon and Northwest Territories)</li>
            <li>Alaska (Fairbanks)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>The term "Aurora Borealis" was coined by Galileo Galilei in 1619. It is derived from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas.</p>
