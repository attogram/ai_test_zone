Okay, let's do some ASCII art! Here's a simple cat:

     /\_/\
    ( o.o )
    > ^ <

How about a little tree?

     /\
    /  \
   /    \
  /______\
     ||
     ||
     ||
    ====

Would you like me to try something else, like a heart, a star, or perhaps a more complex image?  Let me know what you'd like to see!
