Okay! Here's my attempt at some ASCII art. I'll go for a simple cat. 

     /\_/\
    ( o.o )
    > ^ < 
     
  /   \
 |     |
  \   /
   ---
   |||
   |||
  /   \
 /     \
|       |
 \_____/



I tried to make it a little bit expressive!  Let me know if you'd like me to try a different shape or a more complex one.  I can also try a different animal! ðŸ˜Š
