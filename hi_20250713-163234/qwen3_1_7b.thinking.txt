Okay, the user said "hi". I need to respond politely. Let me check if there's any specific context I should consider. Since they just greeted me, a simple and friendly reply would be best. Maybe something like "Hello! How can I assist you today?" That's open-ended and invites them to ask questions. I should make sure the tone is welcoming and helpful. No need for any extra information here. Just a standard greeting.
