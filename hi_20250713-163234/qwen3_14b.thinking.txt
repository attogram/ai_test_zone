Okay, the user said "hi". I need to respond appropriately. Since it's a greeting, I should reply with a friendly greeting. Maybe "Hello! How can I assist you today?" That sounds good. It's polite and opens the door for them to ask for help. I don't need to add anything else unless they respond. Let me make sure there's no typo and that the tone is friendly. Yep, that should work.
