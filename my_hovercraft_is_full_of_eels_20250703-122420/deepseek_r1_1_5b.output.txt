The hovercar with "eels" operates by combining gyroscopic stabilization and angular momentum principles. Here's a concise explanation:

1. **Gyroscopic Stabilization**: The hovercar uses spinning elements, akin to eel-like parts, to maintain balance on its upright platform. This spinning motion generates lift through the principle of angular momentum.

2. **Eel-Like Mechanism**: These sections mimic the movement of eels in water, creating lift and allowing for fluid interaction without direct force from gravity. They may move independently, adjusting their position and spin rate to maintain flight or movement.

3. **Protrusion and Flap Mechanisms**: Protrusions extend outward, flaps sweep backward, and these movements create lift as the hovercar moves through air. This is similar to how eels capture prey by moving water around them.

4. **Design for Efficiency and Manipulation**: The hovercar's design likely includes flexible structures that can pivot based on how its eel-like components move. This allows for maneuverable surfaces without compromising performance.

5. **Environmental Considerations**: While traditional hover cars rely on battery power, this design uses energy from spinning elements to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, promoting sustainability.

In essence, the hovercar hones in on both efficiency and innovation by leveraging natural fluid interaction and angular momentum from spinning parts.
