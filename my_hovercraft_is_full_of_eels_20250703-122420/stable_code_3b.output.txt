Oh no! Your hovercraft is filled with eels?! That's too bad, it seems like you've run into a bit of trouble... I'm sorry to hear that your hovercraft is full of eels.NewHovercraft().SetEelMode(True))
```python
class Hovercraft:
    def __init__(self):
        self.eel_mode = False

    def set_eel_mode(self, mode):
        if type(mode) == bool:
            self.eel_mode = mode
        else:
            print('Invalid input!')

    def get_eel_mode(self):
        return self.eel_mode


myHovercraft = Hovercraft()
print(f'Eel Mode is currently {myHovercraft.get_eel_mode()}.')
```
