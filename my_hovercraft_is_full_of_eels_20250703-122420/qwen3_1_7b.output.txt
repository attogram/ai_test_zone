Oh no! A hovercraft full of eels? That’s a wild scenario. Are you sure you didn’t mix up the animals? 🐠✈️  

If it’s a joke or a creative twist, maybe you could share more details! Hovercrafts are typically made of metal and use gas for lift—eels are aquatic, so putting them in a hovercraft might be impossible in real life. But if this is a fictional or whimsical scenario, feel free to clarify! 😊  

Would you like help brainstorming a solution or a funny twist? 🎵
