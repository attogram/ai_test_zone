The phrase "My hovercraft is full of eels" is not an ordinary expression and has been widely used in popular culture. It was originally said by the character Basil Exposition (played by Rik Mayall) in the British sitcom "Blackadder Goes Forth," which aired in 1989.

The meaning behind this phrase is not entirely clear, as it could be referring to something being incredibly full of something else or simply making no sense at all. However, it is now often used by people in similar contexts when they want to say something that doesn't make sense, but still keeps the interest of their listeners.
