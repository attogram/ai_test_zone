That's quite an unusual and intriguing scenario! Eels are fascinating creatures that can be found in various parts of the world, some living in freshwater lakes and rivers, while others prefer saltwater environments such as oceans and coastal areas.

If you're planning to operate a hovercraft with eels on board, it's important to consider several factors:

1. **Eel Species**: Different species of eels have different habits, habitats, and behaviors. Some are more docile than others, so research the specific type of eel you intend to transport.

2. **Container and Space**: Ensure that your hovercraft is equipped with suitable containers or tanks where the eels can be comfortably housed during transit. The containers should provide adequate water quality, temperature control, and space for the eels to swim around.

3. **Food and Water**: Eels require a consistent supply of fresh food and clean water. Make sure you have provisions for feeding them during the journey.

4. **Environmental Conditions**: Monitor the environmental conditions inside the hovercraft, including water quality, temperature, and lighting. Eels are sensitive to changes in these conditions, so maintaining stable and optimal conditions is crucial.

5. **Handling**: Be careful when handling eels to avoid injury or stress. They can be slippery and may struggle if not handled properly.

6. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Check local laws and regulations regarding the transportation of animals on hovercrafts, especially if you are crossing international borders. Ensure that your operations comply with all relevant legal requirements.

7. **Health Monitoring**: Keep a close eye on the health of the eels during transit. Signs of stress or illness should be addressed promptly to prevent any potential problems.

If you're planning a commercial operation involving hovercrafts and eels, consider consulting with experts in aquatic biology, shipping regulations, and transportation logistics to ensure everything is done safely and legally.

It's also worth noting that handling live animals, especially those that can potentially bite or sting, requires special precautions and knowledge. Make sure you are well-prepared and trained for such operations.
