That's an interesting phrase! The line "My hovercraft is full of eels" doesn't have a clear origin or specific meaning in English literature or culture. It could be considered a nonsense phrase or a play on words, as "hovercraft" typically refers to a type of transportation vehicle that uses air pressure for propulsion and movement, while "eels" are long, slimy fish.

If you're referring to something else with this phrase, please provide more context so I can help you better.
