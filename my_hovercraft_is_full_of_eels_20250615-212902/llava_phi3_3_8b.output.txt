It seems that you have encountered a situation where your hovercraft is filled with eels. This could be potentially dangerous and challenging, as eels are known for their slippery and elusive nature. It is important to carefully and safely remove the eels from the hovercraft without harming them or causing any damage to the vehicle. It may also be necessary to properly dispose of the eels in a humane manner if they cannot be returned to their natural habitat. In addition, it may be helpful to take preventative measures such as using nets and screens to protect your hovercraft from future incidents like this.
