This is a classic philosophical thought experiment! Here's the breakdown:

*   **Socrates is a human.** This is a factual statement.
*   **All humans are mortal.** This is a statement of truth, based on our understanding of human biology and mortality.
*   **Therefore, Socrates is mortal.**  Since Socrates is a human and all humans are mortal, it logically follows that Socrates is mortal.

**However, this is a tricky question because it touches on the nature of knowledge and certainty.**

*   **Socrates might be immortal (a belief held by some).**  He was known for his wisdom and contemplation, and it's possible he *believed* he was immortal. But that doesn’t change the fact that he is human. 

**In short, the conclusion is yes, based on the given premises.**

Let me know if you'd like to explore this further – perhaps a discussion about the concept of "proof" or the limitations of human knowledge!
