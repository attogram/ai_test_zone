Thinking...
Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. It goes like this: 

- Socrates is a human.
- All humans are mortal.
- Is Socrates mortal?

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, I know that "Socrates is a human" is a fact. So, S is a member of the set of humans. Then, "All humans are mortal." That seems like a universal statement, meaning every one in the category of humans has that quality of being mortal.

So, if all humans are mortal, and Socrates is a human, then by the terms of logic, we should be able to conclude that Socrates is mortal. It's like applying syllogistic reasoning here. Let me think about it more formally. 

In categorical syllogism, we have three parts: major term, minor term, and middle term. The major term is the predicate of the conclusion, which in this case would be "mortal." The minor term is the subject of the conclusion, so that's "Socrates." The middle term is the one that appears in both premises, here it's "human."

So, the syllogism would look like:

1. All humans are mortal. (Middle term: human)
2. Socrates is a human. (Middle term: human and Socrates)
3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (Conclusion)

I think this fits perfectly because both premises share the middle term "human," allowing us to draw a conclusion about Socrates. Since all humans are mortal and Socrates is human, it logically follows that he must be mortal.

Wait, but what if there's some ambiguity? Could "All humans are mortal" be interpreted differently? Like, maybe "human" isn't the only category in question. But no, in this context, since we're talking about humans specifically, and the conclusion is about Socrates being mortal, it makes sense that all humans share that quality.

Also, I should consider if there's any leap of logic here. The statements are straightforward. "All" means every single one without exception. So, if all humans have the property, then any human does too. There's no need for an anecdote or example because it's a universal statement.

I don't think there are exceptions here, so Socrates being mortal is an inevitable conclusion based on the premises given.
...done thinking.

Socrates is a human, and all humans are mortal. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Premises:**
   - **Premise 1:** Socrates is a human.
   - **Premise 2:** All humans are mortal.

2. **Determine the Middle Term:**
   - The middle term in both premises is "human."

3. **Formulate the Conclusion:**
   - By applying categorical syllogism, since all humans are mortal and Socrates is a human, it logically follows that Socrates is mortal.

**Answer:** Yes, Socrates is mortal.
