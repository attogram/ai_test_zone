Here's a refactored version of the function that does not use the `$statsInfo` array:
```
function addModelToIndexFile {
    responseWords=$(wc -w < "$modelFile" | awk '{print $1}')
    responseBytes=$(wc -c < "$modelFile" | awk '{print $1}')

    while read -r line; do
        value=$(echo "$line" | cut -d ':' -f2)
        if [[ -n "$value" ]]; then
            echo "<tr><td class='left'><a href='./$model.html'>$model</a></td><td >$responseWords</td><td>${responseBytes}</td><td>${value}</td></tr>" >> "$indexFile"
        fi
    done < "$statsFile"
}
```
This version directly reads the `$statsFile` and outputs the values to the index file without using an array. It also fixes a bug in your original code where you were only outputting a `<td>` element if the `value` variable was not empty, which could cause the table row to be incomplete if some of the statistics were missing.
