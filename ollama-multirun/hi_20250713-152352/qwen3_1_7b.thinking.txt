Okay, the user said "hi". I need to respond in a friendly and helpful way. Let me start by acknowledging their greeting. Maybe say something like "Hello!" to keep it simple. Then, offer assistance. Since they might not have specified their needs, I should ask how I can help them. Keep the tone welcoming and open. Avoid any technical jargon. Make sure it's concise but warm. Let me check for any possible misunderstandings. They just said hi, so no need to overcomplicate. Alright, that should cover it.
