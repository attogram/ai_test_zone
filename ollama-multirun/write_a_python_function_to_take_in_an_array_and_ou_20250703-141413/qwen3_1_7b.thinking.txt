Okay, I need to write a Python function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list of its contents. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function should take an array as input. Let's assume the array can contain any type of elements, but for the purpose of generating an HTML list, maybe it's best to assume that the elements are strings or simple objects. But the problem doesn't specify, so I'll just process them as they are.

The output should be an HTML list. So, in HTML, a list is typically done with <ul> or <ol> tags. Since the problem doesn't specify whether it's an unordered or ordered list, maybe I should use <ul> for a normal list. But maybe the user wants ordered list? Hmm, the problem says "html list of the array contents," so perhaps it's an unordered list. But maybe the user wants to use <ol> for ordered. Wait, the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should use <ul> as the default.

So, the function will need to generate a string that represents an HTML unordered list. Each element of the array will be a list item.

So, for example, if the input array is [ "apple", "banana", "cherry" ], the output should be:

<ul>
<li>apple</li>
<li>banana</li>
<li>cherry</li>
</ul>

But how to generate this in Python.

So, the function will take the array, loop through each element, and create the HTML list items.

So, the steps are:

1. Check if the input is an array. Wait, in Python, the function will receive a list. So, the function can assume that the input is a list.

2. Iterate over each element in the list.

3. For each element, create a <li> tag with the element's text.

4. Combine all these into a <ul> tag.

So, the function can be written as:

def array_to_html_list(arr):
    html = "<ul>\n"
    for item in arr:
        html += f"<li>{item}</li>\n"
    html += "</ul>"
    return html

Wait, but what if the array is empty? Then the HTML would be empty. That's okay.

But maybe the user wants to handle cases where the array is empty? Well, the problem doesn't specify, so the function can just return the empty string if the array is empty.

Testing this function with the example array [ "apple", "banana", "cherry" ] would produce the correct HTML.

But maybe the user wants to use <ol> instead of <ul>? Well, the problem says "html list of the array contents," which is typically unordered. So <ul> is appropriate.

But maybe the user wants to use <ol> for ordered list. However, the problem doesn't specify, so I'll stick with <ul>.

Another thing to consider: what if the elements are not strings? For example, if the array contains numbers or other objects. But the problem doesn't specify, so the function will just output the elements as they are, assuming they are strings. But perhaps the user wants to handle different types. However, the problem doesn't mention that, so the function can proceed as is.

So, the function is straightforward. Let me write the code.

Wait, the function is supposed to take in an array. So, the function's parameter is a list. So, the code would be:

def array_to_html_list(arr):
    html = "<ul>\n"
    for item in arr:
        html += f"<li>{item}</li>\n"
    html += "</ul>"
    return html

But maybe the user wants to handle cases where the array is empty. For example, if the array is empty, the HTML would be empty. Which is correct.

Testing this function, if the input is an empty list, it returns an empty string. Which is correct.

So, this should work. Let me check for possible errors.

Wait, what if the array has elements that are not strings? For example, if the array has numbers. Then the HTML would have <li>1</li> etc. Which is correct, as per the problem statement.

So, the function is correct.

Therefore, the code is as written.
