Okay, I need to write a Python function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function should accept an array. Let's assume it's a list of strings, but maybe it can handle other types too. The output needs to be an HTML unordered list. So, the HTML structure would start with <ul>, then each item in the array would be a <li> element inside that.

So, for example, if the input is ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"], the output should be:

<ul>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Banana</li>
  <li>Cherry</li>
</ul>

Wait, but maybe the user wants the list to be ordered? The question says "html list", which could be either unordered or ordered. But since they didn't specify, maybe it's safer to use unordered list (<ul>) by default. Unless the function has an option for ordered, but the question doesn't mention that. So I'll stick with <ul>.

Now, how to generate this in Python. The function will need to take the array and return a string with the HTML.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Start with the opening <ul> tag.
2. Loop through each item in the array, and for each, add a <li> tag with the item's content, then close the </li>.
3. Close the </ul> tag.

So, the function could be something like:

def array_to_html_list(arr):
    html = '<ul>\n'
    for item in arr:
        html += f'  <li>{item}</li>\n'
    html += '</ul>'
    return html

Wait, but what if the array is empty? Well, the code would still work, just return <ul></ul>, which is valid HTML.

Testing with the example:

array_to_html_list(["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]) should return the string as above.

But maybe the user wants the list items to be escaped? Like, if the array contains HTML tags, should they be escaped? The question doesn't mention that, so perhaps assume that the array elements are plain text and not HTML. So no escaping is needed.

But maybe the function should handle cases where the elements are not strings? For example, if the array has numbers, they would be converted to strings automatically when inserting into the HTML.

So, the function should work for any array, and each element is converted to a string.

Wait, in Python, if the array has integers, like [1,2,3], then when we do f'  <li>{item}</li>\n', it would convert them to strings, so that's okay.

So the function is straightforward.

Let me check for edge cases. What if the array is empty? Then the HTML is just <ul></ul>, which is correct.

Another edge case: array with one element. The code would generate <ul><li>item</li></ul>, which is correct.

So, the function seems to handle that.

Now, the user said "take in an array". In Python, an array can be a list. So the function takes a list as input.

So the function is as I outlined.

But maybe the user wants the HTML to be a string that can be written to a file or embedded in a webpage. The function returns the string, which is correct.

So, the code should be:

def array_to_html_list(arr):
    html = '<ul>\n'
    for item in arr:
        html += f'  <li>{item}</li>\n'
    html += '</ul>'
    return html

Yes. Let me test this with a sample.

Sample input: ["Apple", "Banana", "Chander"]

Output would be:

<ul>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Banana</li>
  <li>Chander</li>
</ul>

Which is correct.

Another test case: empty array. Output is <ul></ul>.

Another case: array with numbers: [1,2,3] would produce <li>1</li> etc.

So this should work.

I think that's the solution. The function is simple and straightforward.
