Alright, the user said "hi" and I'm responding with "Hi, how can I assist you today?" They might be testing my response, or they could be looking for help. Since they didn't ask a specific question, I should acknowledge their greeting and offer assistance. I should keep it friendly and open-ended. Let me make sure to respond in a way that's helpful and engaging.
