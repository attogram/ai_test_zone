Okay, the user said "hi" and I need to respond. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I should acknowledge their greeting. Maybe start with a friendly "Hello!" to be welcoming. Then, I can ask how I can assist them today. That way, I'm showing I'm ready to help. I should keep it simple and positive. Maybe add an emoji to make it more friendly, like a smiley face. Let me check if there's anything else. Oh, maybe mention that I'm here to help with any questions or tasks they might have. Yeah, that sounds good. Keep it concise but approachable. Alright, that should work.
