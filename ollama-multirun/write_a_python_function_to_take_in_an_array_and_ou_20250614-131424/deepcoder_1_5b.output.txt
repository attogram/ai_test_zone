<think>
Okay, I need to write a Python function that takes an array and outputs a HTML list of the array contents. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should understand what the user wants. They want a function that converts an array into a HTML list structure. So, for example, if the input is [1,2,3], the output should be something like a list with elements 1, 2, 3.

I remember that in HTML, a list can be represented using <ul> tags or even <li> elements within a <ul>. But perhaps using an <ul> with li for each item would be straightforward.

So, the plan is to create a function that takes each element of the array and wraps them in <li> tags inside a <ul> tag. Also, I should include some styling like color and padding for better appearance.

Wait, but looking at the example given by the user, they showed an HTML list with line breaks and indents. So maybe using <ul> is not enough because it would create a single-level list. Alternatively, perhaps using <ol> tags would be more appropriate since they handle lists well.

Let me think about the structure. Each element in the array should be inside an <ol> tag, which contains all the elements. Or wait, maybe each element is within a <li>, so maybe it's better to use <ul> with each item as a separate <li>.

Alternatively, perhaps using a simple list structure with line breaks and indentation.

But perhaps the simplest way is to create a string that starts with <ul>, then each item is in <li>, and the entire thing is within a <div> or something. Hmm, maybe not. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the function should output a single <ul> element containing all the array items as <li> elements. So for [1,2,3], it would be <ul><li>1</li><li>2</li><li>3</li></ul>.

But looking at the example in the question, perhaps they want each item on a new line with some indentation. For instance:

<ol>
<li>1</li>
<li>2</li>
<li>3</li>
</ol>

Wait, but perhaps it's better to just create a list of lists, where each element is wrapped in <a> tags or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the simplest approach is to loop through each item and add them as <div> elements inside an <ul> tag. Or perhaps use a more straightforward structure with line breaks and indentation.

But perhaps for this problem, the most straightforward way is to create a string that starts with "<ul>", then each element is on a new line with some indentation, followed by "</ul>". Wait, but looking at the example in the question, it's written as:

<ol>
<li>1</li>
<li>2</li>
<li>3</li>
</ol>

Which suggests that each item is inside <li> tags and within an <ol> tag. So perhaps the function should create a list structure with <ol> containing all items.

So, to construct this, I can start by creating an empty string, then for each element in the array, add a line starting with "<li>", followed by the element, then add "</ol>" at the end.

But wait, looking at the example, perhaps it's better to have each item on its own line, indented. So maybe using <ul> and adding lines inside with indentation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to create a string that starts with "<ul>", then for each element, add " ", followed by "<li>", then the element, then "</ul>". But that might not look right.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider how to structure the HTML. Let's think about what the user expects. They said output a html list of the array contents. So perhaps it's better to create an unordered list (using <ol>) with each item as <li> elements.

So for example, given [1,2,3], the HTML would be:

<ul>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>3</li>
</ul>

But perhaps the user wants it to look like a list with each item on its own line. So maybe using <ol> and then each item as <li> with some indentation.

Alternatively, perhaps just create a string that starts with "<ul>", then for each element, add " ", then "<li>", then the element, then "</ul>". But I'm not sure if that's necessary unless specified.

Looking back at the problem statement: it says to write a Python function to take in an array and output a html list of the array contents. So perhaps the simplest way is to create each item as a <li> within an <ul>, which contains all items.

So, let's outline the steps:

1. Take the input array.
2. For each element in the array, wrap it with <li>.
3. Enclose all these <li> elements within a <ul> tag.
4. Return the resulting string.

But perhaps to make it look more like a standard HTML list, we can add line breaks and indentations as shown in the example.

Wait, perhaps I should consider how the sample looks. For instance, if the array is [1,2,3], the output should be something like:

<ol>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>3</li>
</ol>

So each item is on a new line with indentation.

Therefore, perhaps the function can create each li element within an ol element. So for each element in the array, we add a line starting with <li>, then the element, and then </ol>.

But wait, no, because that would just create individual list items. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to structure it as:

<ul>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>3</li>
</ul>

Which is more of a standard unordered list.

So, let's proceed with the idea that each element is wrapped in <li>, and all are inside an <ul>.

Therefore, the function can be written as follows:

- Create an empty string.
- Loop through each item in the array.
- For each item, append " <li> + str(item) + </li>" to the string.
- Finally, wrap this entire thing with "<ul>" and "</ul>".

So, putting it together:

def array_to_html(arr):
    return '<ul>' + '<div>'.join(' <li>{0}</li>'.format(x) for x in arr) + '</ul>'

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think about how to construct this.

Another approach: create a list of strings where each element is " <li>{item}</li>", then join them with ", ", and wrap it in <ul>...</ul>.

Alternatively, using a generator expression inside an f-string.

So, the code could be:

import itertools

def array_to_html(arr):
    return f'<ul>${"".join(" <li>{x}</li>" for x in arr)}</ul>'

Wait, let's test this logic. For example, if arr is [1,2,3], then the join would create " <li>1</li>, <li>2</li>, <li>3</li>", which when joined with ", " becomes " <li>1</li>, <li>2</li>, <li>3</li>".

Then wrapping that in <ul>...</ul> gives the correct HTML list.

Yes, this should work.

So putting it all together:

def array_to_html(array):
    return f'<ul>{"".join(" <li>{x}</li>" for x in array)}</ul>'

Testing this with [1,2,3] would give:

<ul>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>3</li>
</ul>

Which is correct.

So I think this should be the function. Now, let's write it.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to write a Python function that takes an array and outputs a HTML list representation of the array contents. The goal is to convert each element of the array into a structured HTML element within a list.

### Approach
The approach involves converting each element of the input array into a `<li>` tag within a `<ul>` tag, which wraps all elements together. This way, we can create an unordered list structure where each item from the array is properly formatted and indented.

Here are the detailed steps:
1. **Convert Elements to HTML Tags**: Each element in the array is converted into a `<li>` tag.
2. **Wrap in `<ul>` Tag**: All `<li>` tags are placed within a `<ul>` tag to form a complete list structure.
3. **Formatting**: Use string formatting to ensure each item starts on a new line with proper indentation.

### Solution Code
```python
def array_to_html(array):
    return f'<ul>{"".join(" <li>{x}</li>" for x in array)}</ul>'
```

### Explanation
- The function `array_to_html` takes an array as input.
- It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the array, converting each element into a string formatted as `<li>{x}</li>`.
- These strings are joined together with ", " to form a list of items separated by commas.
- This joined string is then enclosed within `<ul>` tags to form the complete HTML list structure.

This approach ensures that each element from the input array is properly structured and indented, creating a clean and readable HTML list.
