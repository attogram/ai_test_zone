Thinking...
Okay, so I need to figure out how many 'r's are in the word "Strawberry". Let me start by writing down the word to visualize it better. S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y.

Hmm, let me spell it out again: S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Wait, is that right? Let me check. S is first, then T, then R, A, W, B, E, R, R, Y. Yeah, that's correct. So the letters are S, T, R, A, W, B, E, R, R, Y.

Now, I need to count the number of 'r's. Let's go through each letter one by one. 

First letter: S – not an 'r'. Second letter: T – no. Third letter: R – that's one 'r'. Fourth letter: A – no. Fifth letter: W – no. Sixth letter: B – no. Seventh letter: E – no. Eighth letter: R – that's another 'r'. Ninth letter: R – another 'r'. Tenth letter: Y – no. 

So counting them: the third letter is the first 'r', the eighth and ninth letters are both 'r's. That's three 'r's in total. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any. Let me go through again.

S (1), T (2), R (3), A (4), W (5), B (6), E (7), R (8), R (9), Y (10). Yep, positions 3, 8, and 9. So three 'r's. 

But wait, sometimes people might confuse the letters or miscount. Let me check again. The word is "Strawberry". Let me write it out with the letters:

S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. So between the first and second 'r's, there's a space. Wait, no, the letters are S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. So after the first 'r' at position 3, there's a space, then A, W, B, E, then another 'r' at position 8 and another at 9. So yes, three 'r's. 

I think that's correct. Maybe I can check by looking at the spelling again. Strawberry is spelled S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. So the 'r's are in the third, eighth, and ninth positions. So three 'r's. 

I don't see any other 'r's. The word doesn't have any other 'r's. So the answer should be 3.
...done thinking.

To determine how many **r's** are in the word **"Strawberry"**, we begin by carefully analyzing the spelling of the word:

**S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y**

Now, we identify the positions of the letter **'r'**:

- **Position 3**: 'R'  
- **Position 8**: 'R'  
- **Position 9**: 'R'

These are the only instances where the letter **'r'** appears in the word.
