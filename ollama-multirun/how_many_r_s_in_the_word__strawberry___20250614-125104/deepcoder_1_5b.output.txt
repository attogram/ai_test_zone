Okay, so I need to figure out how many times the letter 'r' appears in the word "Strawberry." Hmm, let me start by writing down the word and then going through each letter one by one.

The word is "Strawberry." Let's break it down:

S - first letter,
t - second,
r - third,
a - fourth,
w - fifth,
n - sixth,
d - seventh,
e - eighth,
r - ninth,
y - tenth.

Wait, let me make sure I get the spelling right. Maybe I should count each letter carefully to avoid mistakes. Let's write it out:

S t r a w b e r r y

Now, wait, is that correct? Let me check again. The original word is "Strawberry." So breaking it down:

S (1),
t (2),
r (3),
a (4),
w (5),
b (6),
e (7),
r (8),
r (9),
y (10).

Wait, that doesn't seem right because I thought the original word was "Strawberry," which has 10 letters. Let me verify:

S t r a w b e r y? No, perhaps it's better to write it out letter by letter.

Alternatively, maybe using another approach: count each character in "Strawberry."

Let's see:

S - first,
t - second,
r - third,
a - fourth,
w - fifth,
b - sixth,
e - seventh,
r - eighth,
r - ninth,
y - tenth.

Wait, that doesn't add up because "Strawberry" is spelled S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y? Wait, no. Let me check the spelling again. The word is "Strawberry." So let's spell it correctly:

S T R A W B E R R Y? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Maybe another approach: write out each letter and count 'r's step by step.

So starting with "Strawberry":

1st letter: S
2nd letter: t
3rd letter: r
4th letter: a
5th letter: w
6th letter: b
7th letter: e
8th letter: r
9th letter: r
10th letter: y

Wait, that seems like 10 letters. So in this case:

Positions:
1: S
2: t
3: r
4: a
5: w
6: b
7: e
8: r
9: r
10: y

So now, let's count the number of 'r's.

Looking at each position:

3rd letter is 'r' - that's one.
8th letter is 'r' - that's two.
9th letter is 'r' - that's three.

Wait, does that mean there are three 'r's? Let me double-check by writing out the word again:

S t r a w b e r r y

Now, let's go through each character:

1. S
2. t
3. r (count 1)
4. a
5. w
6. b
7. e
8. r (count 2)
9. r (count 3)
10. y

Yes, that makes it three 'r's.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the spelling count because sometimes when we write "Strawberry," it might have a different number of letters. Let me check online or recall if I know how many letters are in "Strawberry." Wait, actually, maybe it's better to just list each letter step by step.

Starting from the beginning:

S (1), then t (2), r (3), a (4), w (5), b (6), e (7), r (8), r (9), y (10). So that would be ten letters. Now, let's list each position and note whether it's an 'r':

Position 1: S - not r
Position 2: t - not r
Position 3: r - yes, count=1
Position 4: a - no
Position 5: w - no
Position 6: b - no
Position 7: e - no
Position 8: r - yes, count=2
Position 9: r - yes, count=3
Position 10: y - no

So total of three 'r's. Therefore, the answer should be 3.

But just to make sure I didn't miscount, let me write out each letter again:

S (1), t (2), r (3), a (4), w (5), b (6), e (7), r (8), r (9), y (10).

So positions 3, 8, and 9 are 'r's. That's three in total.

I think that makes sense. So the number of 'r's in "Strawberry" is three.

The word "Strawberry" contains three instances of the letter 'r'. Here's the breakdown:

- The third letter is 'r'.
- The eighth letter is another 'r'.
- The ninth letter is the final 'r'.

Thus, there are three 'r's in total.

$\boxed{3}$
