Yes, based on the given premises:

1. Socrates is a human (given)
2. All humans are mortal (given)

Using logical deduction:
Since Socrates is a human, and all humans are mortal, therefore Socrates must be mortal.

This is an example of syllogistic reasoning in logic: All A's are B's, X is an A, therefore X is a B.
