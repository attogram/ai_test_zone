Yes, Socrates is mortal.

This conclusion follows logically from the two premises provided:

1. Socrates is a human.
2. All humans are mortal.

Since Socrates falls into the category of humans, and all humans share the property of being mortal, it necessarily follows that Socrates too is mortal. This is an example of a syllogism, a form of logical argument that consists of two premises followed by a conclusion that logically follows from those premises.
