Here's the answer: 

No, Socrates is not mortal. In fact, Socrates was known for his unwavering adherence to virtue and ethics throughout his life. He often walked in his robes at night on the sand of Delphi where he could think freely about the matter without fear of punishment or social disapproval. This allowed him to live a virtuous and free-spirited life, which is not characteristic of any mortal individual.
