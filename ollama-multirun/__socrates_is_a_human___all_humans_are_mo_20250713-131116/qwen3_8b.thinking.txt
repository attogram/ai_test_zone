Okay, let's see. The user provided two premises: "Socrates is a human" and "All humans are mortal." Then they're asking, "Is Socrates mortal?" I need to figure out how to answer this logically.

First, I should recall basic logic principles. If all humans are mortal, then any individual who is a human must be mortal. Since Socrates is a human, applying the universal statement to Socrates should lead to the conclusion that he's mortal. But wait, maybe I should break it down step by step to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Let me start by restating the premises. The first premise is that Socrates is a human. The second is a universal statement: for all x, if x is a human, then x is mortal. So, using modus ponens here. Modus ponens says that if we have "If P, then Q" and "P," then we can conclude "Q." 

Applying that here: P is "Socrates is a human," and Q is "Socrates is mortal." Since we have both premises, we can conclude Q. Therefore, Socrates must be mortal. 

But wait, is there any possibility that the premises could be interpreted differently? For example, could "All humans are mortal" be interpreted in a way that excludes Socrates? Probably not, because the statement is universal. Unless there's some hidden assumption, like maybe Socrates isn't a human, but the first premise says he is. So there's no contradiction here.

Another angle: maybe the user is testing if I understand syllogistic logic. The classic syllogism here is: All M are P. S is M. Therefore, S is P. Where M is humans, P is mortals, and S is Socrates. That fits the form of a valid syllogism, specifically the Barbara syllogism. So the conclusion follows necessarily.

I should also check if there's any ambiguity in the terms. "Human" and "mortal" are clear here. The premises are straightforward. There's no equivocation or hidden meaning. So the conclusion is solid.

Wait, could there be an exception? Like, maybe Socrates is an exception to the rule that all humans are mortal? But the premises state that all humans are mortal, so unless there's a contradiction in the premises, which there isn't, the conclusion holds. The premises are given as true, so we can't question their validity here.

Therefore, combining the two premises using modus ponens or syllogistic reasoning leads directly to the conclusion that Socrates is mortal. There's no need for further information or assumptions. The answer should be straightforward.
