Yes, Socrates is mortal. Here's the logical reasoning:

1. **Premise 1**: "Socrates is a human."  
2. **Premise 2**: "All humans are mortal."  

Using **modus ponens** (if *P* â†’ *Q* and *P*, then *Q*):  
- Let *P* = "Socrates is a human" (Premise 1).  
- Let *Q* = "Socrates is mortal" (from Premise 2).  

Since both premises are true, we conclude **Q**: **Socrates is mortal**.  

This follows the classic syllogism structure (Barbara syllogism) and is a valid deductive argument. No ambiguity or exceptions are introduced in the premises.  

**Answer**: Yes, Socrates is mortal.
