Yes, Socrates is mortal. This can be concluded through basic logical reasoning based on the given premises:

- **Premise 1:** Socrates is a human.
- **Premise 2:** All humans are mortal.

Since Socrates belongs to the category of "humans" and all members of that category are mortal, it follows that Socrates must be mortal. This is an example of a categorical syllogism in logic, where if something is part of a universal class with a certain property, it inherits that property.
