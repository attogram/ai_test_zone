Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Socrates is mortal based on the two statements given. The first statement says that Socrates is a human, and the second one states that all humans are mortal. 

Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand each part correctly. First, I know that Socrates was an ancient Greek philosopher, so he's definitely a person, which means he falls under the category of being a human. That makes sense with the first statement.

Now, the second statement is a universal claim: all humans are mortal. Mortal means that humans are subject to death; we don't live forever. So if every single human being is mortal, then any individual human should be mortal as well.

Putting these two together, since Socrates is a human and all humans are mortal, it logically follows that Socrates must be mortal too. It's like saying if all apples are red and this fruit is an apple, then this fruit is red. The same principle applies here, just with different categories: human and mortal.

I don't think there are any exceptions mentioned in the given statements, so I can't argue against the conclusion that Socrates is mortal based on what's provided. It seems straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something? Let me consider if there's a way to challenge this.

Perhaps someone might argue about the definitions of "human" or "mortal." For example, in some contexts, people discuss immortality or supernatural beings, but those are outside the scope here. The statements stick strictly to logic without introducing any exceptions or suppositions beyond what's stated.

Another angle could be considering if Socrates is an exception, but since he's specifically identified as a human and no special cases are mentioned, that doesn't hold up. So yeah, I think the conclusion is solid based on the premises given.
