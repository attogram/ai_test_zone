A classic example of a syllogism!

Let's break it down:

1. Premise: "Socrates is a human." (We know this to be true)
2. Premise: "All humans are mortal." (This is also known as the "major premise")
3. Conclusion: Is Socrates mortal?

If we apply the logical rule of modus ponens, which states that if p → q and p then q, we can conclude that:

"Socrates is a human" (p)
"All humans are mortal" (q)

Therefore, "Socrates is mortal" (p → q).

So, in this case, we can confidently say: **Yes, Socrates is mortal.**
