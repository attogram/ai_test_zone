This question can be solved using logical reasoning.

Let's break it down step by step:

1) We're given two premises:
   * Premise 1: Socrates is a human
   * Premise 2: All humans are mortal

2) We need to determine if Socrates is mortal based on these premises.

3) Using the premise "All humans are mortal" and knowing that Socrates is a human, we can apply universal instantiation:
   * Since Socrates is a human (Premise 1)
   * And all humans are mortal (Premise 2)
   * Therefore, Socrates must be mortal

So yes, Socrates is mortal.
