Yes, Socrates is mortal. Here's the logical breakdown:

1. **Premise 1**: Socrates is a human.  
2. **Premise 2**: All humans are mortal.  

Using **deductive reasoning** (specifically a syllogism):  
- The major premise ("All humans are mortal") establishes a universal rule.  
- The minor premise ("Socrates is a human") identifies Socrates as a member of the group described by the major premise.  
- The conclusion ("Socrates is mortal") logically follows by applying the universal rule to the specific case.  

**Answer**: Yes, Socrates is mortal.
