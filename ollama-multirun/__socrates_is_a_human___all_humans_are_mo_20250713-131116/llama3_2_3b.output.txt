A classic example of deductive reasoning!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Socrates is a human. (Premise)
2. All humans are mortal. (Premise)

We can infer the following from these premises using logical deduction:

All humans → Mortal (Premise)

Therefore, since Socrates is a human, we can conclude that:

Socrates → Mortal

In other words, it follows logically from the premises that Socrates is mortal.

So, to answer your question: Yes, according to this reasoning, Socrates is indeed mortal.
