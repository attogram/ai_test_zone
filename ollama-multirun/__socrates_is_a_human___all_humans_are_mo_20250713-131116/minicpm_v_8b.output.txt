Yes, based on the given premises that all humans are mortal and since it's stated explicitly in the second premise that "Socrates" is also a human. Therefore we can infer from these statements combined together that indeed Socrates must be mortal too due to universal truth of first two premises being applied here.
It should however be noted, as per general rule for logical reasoning; you don't need three premises here because it's enough with just one premise which specifies all humans are mortal. The second and third ones provide specific details about "Socrates" in order to reach the conclusion that he is indeed a part of this universal statement 'all' people (humans) being mortal.
If we were talking hypothetically, let’s say there was an exception where some human beings weren’t considered as mortality entities. Then yes it's possible Socrates might not be included into such category and hence could have been immortalized but based on provided premises; that doesn't seem to fit the context given here unless additional information is presented which contradicts with these statements or adds more details (which again isn't present).
