Yes, based on the premises provided in classical logic, Socrates would be considered mortal. This follows from a basic deductive reasoning known as a syllogism:

1. Socrates is a human. (Premise)
2. All humans are mortal. (Premise)
3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (Conclusion derived from 1 and 2)

This logical argument forms the basis of the famous paradoxes attributed to the ancient Greek philosopher Eubulides of Megara, who is credited with inventing the concept of "Socratic irony." It's also a classic example in teaching formal logic. In this case, given that both premises are accepted as true, the conclusion logically follows.
