Yes, Socrates is mortal. 

This is a classic example of a deductive argument, specifically a syllogism. The argument is structured as follows:

* **Premise 1:** Socrates is a human.
* **Premise 2:** All humans are mortal.
* **Conclusion:** Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

If the premises are true, the conclusion *must* be true.  Since both premises are generally accepted as true, the conclusion is valid.
