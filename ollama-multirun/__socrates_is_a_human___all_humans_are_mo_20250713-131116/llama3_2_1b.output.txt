A classic example of a syllogism.

Let's break it down:

* The first premise, "Socrates is a human," is true.
* The second premise, "All humans are mortal," is also true.
* Since both premises are true, we can infer the truth of the third premise: "Is Socrates mortal?"

The answer to this question is simply "yes" because Socrates' being a human implies that he is mortal.
