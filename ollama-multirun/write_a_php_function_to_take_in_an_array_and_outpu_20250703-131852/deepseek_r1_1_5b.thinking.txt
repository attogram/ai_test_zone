Okay, I need to write a PHP function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list of its contents. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should consider the structure of the HTML list. Each item in the array should be wrapped in `<li>` tags. So for each value in the input array, I'll create a <li> element.

I remember that in PHP, I can access array elements using $array[$index]. But since arrays can have numeric keys as strings or integers, I need to ensure the keys are correctly formatted. Also, if any values are non-strings, they might cause issues with HTML processing. So maybe converting each value to a string would be safe.

Next, I'll loop through each element of the array. For each item, I'll create a list element that includes both the key and the value, along with some styling for better presentation. Using <ul> and <li> inside it makes sense. The first li should contain an h2 tag with a title like "Array Items", and each subsequent li will have a span with a number and the item's stringified value.

Styling is important so that the output looks clean. I'll set the list to display as left-aligned, have padding, and add some margin between the headings. The list items should also be inline, meaning they share the same line without indentation or new lines.

I'll make sure the function returns a string representing the HTML. So after constructing each li element with its content, I'll join all of them into a single string separated by <br> tags.

Wait, what if the array is empty? In that case, just return an empty list string. Also, handling numeric keys: since PHP uses 0-based indexing, using the numeric value as the key should work without issues.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Check if the input array is empty.
2. Loop through each item in the array.
3. For each item, create a <li> with a span containing the index and stringified item.
4. Create an h2 for the list heading.
5. Collect all these into a ul.
6. Return the joined HTML string.

Testing edge cases: What if there are duplicate keys? I think PHP's array function handles it as strings, so each key will be unique in the loop, but perhaps I should consider that when building the elements to avoid redundant spans.

Putting it all together, the function should handle various input types correctly and produce a well-formatted HTML list.
