Okay, I need to write a PHP function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function should accept an array as a parameter. Maybe I'll name the function something like arrayToHTMLList. Then, I need to generate an unordered list (ul) with list items (li) for each element in the array.

Wait, but what if the array has nested arrays? The user didn't specify, so maybe I should assume it's a flat array. Or perhaps handle nested arrays by recursively creating lists. Hmm, the original question says "output a html list of the array contents", so maybe it's intended for a flat array. But maybe I should check for nested arrays and handle them as well. But since the user didn't mention nested arrays, perhaps it's safer to assume a flat array. Let me proceed with that.

So, the function will start by opening the ul tag. Then loop through each element in the array. For each element, add an li tag with the element's value. Then close the ul tag.

Wait, but how to handle different types of arrays? Like if the array is associative (key-value pairs) versus numeric. The user didn't specify, so maybe the function should output the values regardless of the array type. For example, if it's an associative array, it will list all the values. If it's a numeric array, it will list all the elements.

So the function can just iterate through the array using foreach, and output each value in an li.

But wait, in PHP, if the array is associative, the keys are not considered. So the function will list all the values. That's probably what the user wants.

So the code would be something like:

function arrayToHTMLList($array) {
    echo '<ul>';
    foreach ($array as $item) {
        echo '<li>' . htmlspecialchars($item) . '</li>';
    }
    echo '</ul>';
}

Wait, but using echo directly might not be ideal. Maybe the function should return the HTML string instead, so that the caller can decide where to place it. But the original question says "output a html list", so maybe echo is acceptable.

But perhaps the function should return the HTML string. Let me check the original question again. It says "output a html list of the array contents". So maybe the function should generate the HTML and output it, which would mean using echo.

Alternatively, maybe the function should return the HTML as a string. But the user might want it to output directly. Let me think. The question says "output", so perhaps echo is correct.

But maybe the function should return the HTML so that it can be used flexibly. However, the user might not have specified. Let me proceed with returning the HTML string, as that's more flexible. But the original question says "output", which implies that the function should generate the HTML and output it. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the function can both return and echo. But perhaps the user wants the function to output the HTML. Let me check the original question again: "Write a PHP function to take in an array and output a html list of the array contents". So the function should output the HTML. Therefore, using echo is appropriate.

But in PHP, functions can echo, but sometimes people prefer to return the string. However, the question says "output", so echoing is correct.

Another thing to consider: escaping HTML characters. Using htmlspecialchars is important to prevent XSS. So in the code, each item should be escaped.

So the function would be:

function arrayToHTMLList($array) {
    echo '<ul>';
    foreach ($array as $item) {
        echo '<li>' . htmlspecialchars($item) . '</li>';
    }
    echo '</ul>';
}

But what if the array is empty? Then it will output an empty ul, which is acceptable.

Testing this function: if the array is ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'], it will output a list with those items.

But what about if the array contains other data types, like numbers or booleans? htmlspecialchars will handle them as strings.

So this should work. Let me think if there's anything else. Maybe the function should handle different types of arrays, like multidimensional. But the question doesn't mention that. So the function is correct as is.

So the final code is as above.
