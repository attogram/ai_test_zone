Okay, I need to write a PHP function that takes an array and outputs a HTML list of its contents. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should consider the structure of the HTML list. Each item in the array should be wrapped in <li> tags. So, for each element in the array, I'll create a <li> element.

Next, I need to handle the ordering of the items. The example provided by the user shows that the elements are displayed from left to right as they appear in the array. That means the array should be iterated in its natural order without any manipulation beyond passing it along.

Now, looking at the sample output, each item is within a <div> tag. Wait, no, the example given by the user shows that each element is inside <ul> and then each li is wrapped inside that. So perhaps I need to structure it differently.

Wait, the user's example might have been cut off or miswritten. Let me check the initial problem statement again. It says to output a HTML list of the array contents. Typically, a list in HTML is created using <ul> with each item as <li>. Alternatively, sometimes people use <ol> for ordered lists, but since the example isn't clear, perhaps it's better to assume that each element should be in a <li> tag inside a <ul>.

But looking at the sample output provided by the user:

The output is written as:

<ul>
<li>1</li>
<li>2</li>
...
</ul>

Wait, no. The example given by the user shows an array and then a list of HTML elements within <div> tags. Let me recheck.

In the problem statement, the sample input might be something like [1,2,3], and the output is:

<div>1</div>
<div>2</div>
...

But perhaps that's not accurate. Alternatively, maybe each element is directly inside a <li>, without any surrounding elements.

I think I need to clarify: when the user says "output a html list of the array contents", it usually means each item is in a separate <li> within a <ul>. Or perhaps just each item is placed in its own paragraph or div. But given the sample output provided by the user, let's see.

Looking at the initial example:

The user wrote:

"Write a PHP function to take in an array and output a html list of the array contents"

And then showed some code with an array [1,2,3] and the output as something like:

<ul>
<li>1</li>
<li>2</li>
...
</ul>

But perhaps that's not accurate. Alternatively, maybe each element is directly placed inside <div> tags.

Wait, perhaps it's better to structure it with each element in a separate <li> within a <ul>. So the function will loop through each element of the array, create a <ul>, add each <li> with the corresponding value, and then close the <ul>.

So for example, if the input is [1,2,3], the output would be:

<ul>
<li>1</li>
<li>2</li>
<li>3</li>
</ul>

But looking back at the user's initial problem statement, perhaps they wanted each item to be in its own <div>, but without knowing exactly, I'll proceed with creating a list using <ul> and <li>.

Now, let's outline the steps:

1. Initialize an empty <ul> tag.
2. Loop through each element in the input array.
3. For each element, create a <li> tag containing the element's value.
4. Append each <li> to the <ul>.
5. Close the <ul> after all elements are processed.

But wait, looking at the sample output provided by the user:

In the problem statement, the user shows an array and then writes something like:

"Write a PHP function to take in an array and output a html list of the array contents"

Then perhaps there's an example with [1,2,3] leading to:

<div>1</div>
<div>2</div>
...

Which would mean each element is wrapped in <div>. So perhaps each item is directly inside a div.

In that case, for each element in the array, we create a <div> with the element's value as text content.

So, the function will loop through each element and wrap it in a <div>.

Putting this together, the PHP code would:

- Take the input array.
- Loop over each item in the array.
- For each item, create a string that is "<div>" followed by the item's value.
- Collect all these divs into an array.
- Then, join them with newlines or just output each on its own line.

But perhaps for simplicity, we can directly loop through the array and wrap each element in <li> within a <ul>.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use <ol> for ordered lists. But without more context, I'll assume that each item is a separate list item inside a <ul>.

So, let's structure the code.

Function name: perhaps called something like 'arrayToHTML'.

The function will take an array as input.

Initialize an empty string or array to collect the HTML elements.

Loop through each $item in $array:

- For each $item, create a string that is "<li>$item</li>".
- Add this to a collection.

Then, after collecting all elements, join them with newlines and return as the output.

But perhaps it's more straightforward to directly construct the HTML using sprintf or array_map functions in PHP.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with arrays in PHP, which are zero-indexed, but the order is from left to right as given.

So, let's outline the code step by step.

Function:

function arrayToHTML($array) {

    $html = array();

    foreach ($array as $item) {
        $html[] = "<li>$item</li>";
    }

    return $html;

}

Wait, but the sample output in the problem statement might have each item inside a <div> without any surrounding tags. For example:

Sample Input: [1,2,3]

Sample Output: 

<div>1</div>
<div>2</div>
<div>3</div>

In that case, perhaps each element is directly wrapped in <div>.

So, the code would be:

function arrayToHTML($array) {

    $html = array();

    foreach ($array as $item) {
        $html[] = "<div>$item</div>";
    }

    return $html;

}

But looking back at the problem statement, it says to output a HTML list of the array contents. So perhaps each element is in its own <ul> tag.

Now, considering that when elements are displayed in a list, often they are inside a <ul> with each item as <li>.

Thus, for an array [1,2,3], the output would be:

<ul>
<li>1</li>
<li>2</li>
<li>3</li>
</ul>

So, let's adjust the code to create a <ul> with all the <li>s.

The function would look like this:

function arrayToHTML($array) {

    $html = "<ul>";
    foreach ($array as $item) {
        $html .= "<li>" . $item . "</li>";
    }
    $html .= "</ul>";
    return $html;
}

Testing with [1,2,3], the output would be:

<ul>
<li>1</li>
<li>2</li>
<li>3</li>
</ul>

Which seems correct.

Now, considering the user's example in their problem statement where they wrote an array and then something like <div>1</div>, it's possible that each element is just a single line without any structure. But given the way HTML lists are often structured with list items inside <li> tags within <ul> tags, I think the function should create a proper HTML list as shown above.

Therefore, the final code would be as written.
