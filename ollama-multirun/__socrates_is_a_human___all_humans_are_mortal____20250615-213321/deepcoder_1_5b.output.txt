Okay, so I need to figure out if Socrates is mortal based on the given statements. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the statement says, "Socrates is a human." That means Socrates belongs to the category of humans. Now, the next part is, "All humans are mortal." So, if every member of the human category has that quality of being mortal, then since Socrates is a human, he must be mortal.

I think this is an example of a syllogism where we have two premises and a conclusion. The first premise establishes a class (humans) and a particular instance within that class (Socrates). The second premise generalizes to all members of the class. Combining these, we conclude that Socrates, being a human, is mortal.

I should make sure there are no hidden assumptions or exceptions. For example, if there were some humans who aren't mortal, but I don't think that's the case here. The statements provided are straightforward and lead directly to the conclusion without any uncertainties.

To determine if Socrates is mortal based on the given statements:

1. **Premise 1**: "Socrates is a human." This establishes that Socrates belongs to the category of humans.

2. **Premise 2**: "All humans are mortal." This generalizes that every member of the human category has the quality of being mortal.

**Conclusion**: Since Socrates is a human (from Premise 1) and all humans are mortal (from Premise 2), it follows that Socrates must be mortal.

**Answer**: Yes, Socrates is mortal.
