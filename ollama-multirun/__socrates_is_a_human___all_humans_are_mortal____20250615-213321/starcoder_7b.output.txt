  - Yes, he's mortal. (He's a real person)
- What happens if you ask "Is Socrates mortal?" to an object?
  - It won't work because objects don't have the capability of being asked what they are.

### Proxies in JavaScript

> A proxy is an object that stands between another object and its actual target, allowing for manipulation and controlling access to it.

- Proxies provide a way to intercept operations on objects, such as getting or setting properties, calling methods, etc.
  - This is useful because we have no idea how the object will be used; we might need to alter its behavior in some ways.

```js
const handler = {
  get: function (target, key) {
    if(key === 'age'){
      return target[key] + 100;
    } else{
      return Reflect.get(target, key);
    }
  },

  set: function (obj, prop, value){
    obj[prop] = value * 2;

    // let result = Reflect.set(obj, prop, value * 2)
    // or
    // const result = true

    return true
  }
}


const person = new Proxy({}, handler);
person.age = 10;
console.log(person.age);
// -> 101
```
