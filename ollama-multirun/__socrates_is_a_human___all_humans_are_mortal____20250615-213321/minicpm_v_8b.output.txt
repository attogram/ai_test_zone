Yes, according to the given premises, since all humans (including Socrates) are mortal. Therefore it follows that Socrates must be mortal too. This illustrates an example of Modus Ponens logic where if P implies Q and we know for sure that p is true then q has to also be true.

In this case:
- The premise "All humans are mortal" can be considered as the general rule or statement (P).
- Socrates being a human, means he falls under category 'p', which makes him subject of P.
- It's assumed from given premises that if something is a human then it must necessarily be true for all other things in the same class. Hence "Socrates" here represents an example/case within this general rule (P).

Therefore based on these facts, we can conclude that 'Is Socrates mortal?' - The answer would always remain Yes because of Modus Ponens logic as long as it is given and accepted universally for all humans to be mortals.
