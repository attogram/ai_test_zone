Thinking...
Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking if Socrates is mortal based on the given premises. The premises are: Socrates is a human, and all humans are mortal. 

First, I need to recall some basic logic here. The first premise states that Socrates is a human. The second premise says that all humans are mortal. So, if all humans are mortal, then any individual who is a human must also be mortal. 

But wait, the question is about whether Socrates is mortal. So applying the second premise to the first, since Socrates is a human, and all humans are mortal, then Socrates must be mortal. That seems straightforward. 

However, I should check if there are any exceptions or additional considerations. The premises don't mention anything about exceptions to the rule that all humans are mortal. So, logically, if the premises are given as true, then Socrates must be mortal. 

But maybe the user is trying to test if I'm applying the rules correctly. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. In formal logic, if we have a universal statement "All A are B," then any specific instance of A is also B. So, since Socrates is A (a human), then Socrates is B (mortal). 

Another angle: maybe the user is confused about the terminology. "Mortal" here probably means "dying" or "not eternal." So, if all humans are mortal, then Socrates, being a human, is mortal. 

Is there any possible way this could be false? If the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. So, given the premises, the answer is yes. 

Wait, but maybe the user is thinking about something else. For example, maybe Socrates is a philosopher and not a human? But the first premise says he is a human. So that's not the case. 

I think the answer is straightforward. The premises lead to the conclusion. So, Socrates is mortal.
...done thinking.

Based on the given premises:  
1. **Socrates is a human.**  
2. **All humans are mortal.**  

Logical deduction:  
If all humans are mortal (Premise 2), and Socrates is a human (Premise 1), then by **modus ponens** (a valid argument form in logic), **Socrates must be mortal**.  

**Conclusion:**  
Yes, Socrates is mortal. The premises directly support this conclusion through universal instantiation. No exceptions or additional information are required.
