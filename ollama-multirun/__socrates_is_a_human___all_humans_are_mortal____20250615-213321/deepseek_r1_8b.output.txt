Thinking...
First, the user has given me two premises:

1. Socrates is a human.

2. All humans are mortal.

And then they ask: "Is Socrates mortal?"

This is a classic syllogism from logic. The syllogism goes like this:

- Major premise: All humans are mortal.

- Minor premise: Socrates is human.

- Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

So, based on these premises, the answer should be yes.

I need to respond in a way that's helpful and clear. Since I'm an AI assistant, I should provide reasoning if possible.

The user might be testing my logical reasoning or just giving a simple example. Either way, I should confirm the conclusion.

Possible response structure:

- State the premises clearly.

- Explain how they lead to the conclusion.

- Give the answer directly.

But keep it concise and engaging.

Ensure that my response is truthful and based on the given information.

Finally, box the answer as per the instruction.
...done thinking.

Based on the two premises you provided:

1. Socrates is a human.
2. All humans are mortal.

We can logically conclude that Socrates is mortal. This follows from the rule of universal instantiation in logic: if all members of a category have a certain property, then any specific member also has that property.

So, yes, Socrates is mortal.
