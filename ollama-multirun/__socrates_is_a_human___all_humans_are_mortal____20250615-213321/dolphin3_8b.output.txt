Yes, based on the given information, Socrates is mortal. This conclusion can be drawn from applying the principles of deductive reasoning: 

1. Premise 1: Socrates is a human. 
2. Premise 2: All humans are mortal.
3. Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

This type of argument form is called modus ponens (or more specifically in this case, universal instantiation followed by modus ponens), which is considered sound because it follows the rules of logic and provides a valid conclusion when all premises are true.
