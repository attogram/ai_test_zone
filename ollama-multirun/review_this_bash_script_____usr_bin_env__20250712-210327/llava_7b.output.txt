 This is a Bash script that serves as a multi-run utility for running Ollama, an AI model. It allows the user to specify a prompt and use different models with varying prompts. The script is designed to run multiple times in parallel and can handle various input scenarios.

Here are some notes on the script:

1. **Modularity**: The script has several functions that encapsulate specific tasks, such as parsing command-line arguments, setting up output directories, generating output HTML files, etc. This modular approach makes it easier to understand and maintain the code.

2. **Error Handling**: While handling command-line arguments, if an argument is missing, it will print an error message and exit with a non-zero status.

3. **Usability**: The script provides multiple ways of providing input: interactively (default), from a file, or through standard input. It also supports using different models by specifying them as command-line arguments or in a configuration file.

4. **Timeout Mechanism**: A timeout mechanism is implemented for the prompt execution, allowing the user to control how long Ollama should wait before timing out. This can be useful if the model takes too long to respond.

5. **Sortable Tables with JavaScript**: The script uses a JavaScript library called Sortable to create sortable tables in HTML output files. This allows users to sort the results by different columns (e.g., words, bytes, response time).

6. **Version Information**: The script prints its version information at startup, which can be helpful for debugging purposes.

7. **Resource Utilization**: Since the script runs models in parallel and uses a timeout mechanism, it is important to ensure that this resource-intensive process does not overload the system. You might want to set limits on the number of concurrent processes or adjust the timeout value based on available resources.

8. **Logging and Debugging**: The script does not have extensive logging or debugging features. If you need to troubleshoot issues, consider adding more detailed error messages, log files, or debugging statements to your code.

9. **Security and Privacy**: Depending on the sensitivity of the data being processed, you might need to add security measures such as encryption, authentication, or access control to protect the user's privacy and ensure data confidentiality.

10. **Performance Optimization**: Since the script runs multiple models in parallel, consider optimizing your code for performance by using multi-threading libraries like pthreads, ensuring that each process does not block others (e.g., by using `setrlimit` to limit memory usage), or running the script on a multi-core system if you have access to one.

11. **Support for Different AI Models**: The script is currently designed to work with Ollama, an AI model from the GitHub repository <https://github.com/attogram/ollama>. If you want to support other AI models, you'll need to update the functions that interact with these models (e.g., `runModelWithTimeout`, `setOllamaStats`).

Overall, this script provides a convenient way to run multiple prompts on different models and collect the results in HTML files for easier analysis. However, it does require careful attention to resource utilization and potential security concerns, depending on the sensitivity of the data being processed.
