This bash script is a comprehensive tool for running prompts against multiple models in Ollama and saving the output as web pages. It supports various features such as specifying models, setting output directories, customizing timeout settings, and more. Below is a detailed review of the script:

### Key Features and Functionality

1. **Command Line Parsing**:
   - The script parses command line arguments to handle flags like `-m` for specific models, `-r` for results directory, and `-t` for timeout.
   - It also allows entering the prompt manually or from various sources like files, pipes, or arguments.

2. **Prompt Handling**:
   - Prompts can be entered interactively or provided via command line arguments or standard input.
   - The script sanitizes and saves the prompt to a file along with YAML format for GitHub models.

3. **Model Management**:
   - It lists available models using `ollama list` and allows selecting specific models to run.
   - Models are cleared and stopped after each run to ensure clean sessions.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - The script generates HTML files for each model's output, including the prompt, response, statistics, and system information.
   - It also creates an index page that summarizes all runs.

5. **Statistics Collection**:
   - It collects detailed statistics about each run, including word count, byte count, duration, and evaluation rates.
   - The script can handle images generated by models and save them to the output directory.

### Potential Improvements

1. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - While the script provides basic error handling, it could benefit from more detailed logging. For example, capturing all errors and storing them in a log file for later review.
   - The current approach of printing errors to `stderr` might not be suitable for automation scripts that expect output on `stdout`.

2. **Concurrency**:
   - The script runs models sequentially. Depending on the number of models and the size of the prompts, this can be slow.
   - Introducing concurrency or parallel processing could significantly speed up the execution time.

3. **User Experience**:
   - The HTML generation could use more modern CSS frameworks like Bootstrap for better responsiveness and styling.
   - Adding tooltips or popovers for statistics could help users understand the data better.

4. **Configuration Flexibility**:
   - While flags allow customization, some settings might be too inflexible. For example, adding a configuration file to store default settings and overrides could provide more flexibility.

5. **Security**:
   - The script directly reads from standard input, which could expose it to security risks if not used carefully.
   - Input validation for prompts and arguments should be enhanced to prevent injection attacks or malicious inputs.

### Example Usage

To run the script with a specific prompt and models:

```bash
./multirun.sh -m deepseek-r1:1.5b,deepseek-r1:8b "Example prompt"
```

To use the script interactively:

```bash
./multirun.sh
Enter prompt:
Example prompt
```

### Conclusion

The script is a powerful tool for running and managing Ollama models in batch mode. While it has many features, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance its robustness, performance, and user experience. These suggestions should help make the script more reliable and suitable for production use.
