To solve this problem, we need to create a function that reads multiple lines of input and assigns each line to specific variables based on their section. The sections are structured such that the first word in each line corresponds to a particular type of data (e.g., "Model", "Capabilities", "System", or "License"). Each subsequent word within these sections becomes a keyword assignment.

### Approach
1. **Reading Input**: Read all lines from the input file and split them into individual sections based on whitespace or newlines.
2. **Processing Model Section**: For each line in the Model section, split the line into two parts: the section name (first word) and the content. Assign these to variables starting with "model_".
3. **Processing Capabilities Section**: Each line in the Capabilities section corresponds to a single keyword assignment.
4. **Processing System Section**: For each line in the System section, split the line into multiple parts and assign each part as a keyword variable.
5. **Processing License Section**: Similar to the System section, each line is split into multiple parts and assigned as keyword variables.

### Solution Code
```python
__main__ = {}

# Read all lines from input
import sys

lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]

sections = []
for i, line in enumerate(lines):
    if not line:
        continue  # skip empty lines
    section_name = line[0].lower()
    rest_of_line = line[i+1:] if i+1 < len(line) else ''
    sections.append((section_name, rest_of_line))

# Process each section
for idx, (section_name, content) in enumerate(sections):
    if section_name == 'Model':
        for token in content.split():
            var_name = f'model_{token.lower()}'
            setattr(__main__, var_name, token)
    elif section_name == 'Capabilities':
        __main__.append(content[1] if len(content) > 1 else '')
    else:  # Either System or License
        words = content.split()
        for word in words:
            setattr(__main__, word, None)

print(__main__)
```

### Explanation
- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line and split into sections based on the first character of each line.
- **Model Section Processing**: Each line starting with "Model" is split into two parts: the section name (e.g., "architectures") and the content. These are assigned as separate variables in a dictionary starting with "model_".
- **Capabilities Section Processing**: Each line starting with "Capabilities" contains exactly one keyword assignment, which is appended to a list.
- **System and License Section Processing**: Each line starting with "System" or "License" contains multiple keywords. Each keyword is assigned as a variable in the global scope of the script.

This approach ensures that each section of input is correctly processed and assigned to appropriate variables efficiently.
