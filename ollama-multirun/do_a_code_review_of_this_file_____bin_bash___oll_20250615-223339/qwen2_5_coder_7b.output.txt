  "response": "The script you've provided is a comprehensive tool for running multiple models with a given prompt, tracking their performance, and generating detailed reports. Here's a breakdown of its key functionalities and steps:\n\n1. **Command Line Parsing**: The script starts by parsing command-line arguments to determine the model(s), timeout, prompt, and other settings.\n2. **Model Setup**: It sets up the list of models to be run based on the provided arguments or default values.\n3. **Output Directory Creation**: A directory is created to store all output files for each model run.\n4. **Main Index HTML Creation**: This file provides a high-level overview of all results, linking to individual model runs and their detailed outputs.\n5. **Prompt Saving**: The prompt provided by the user is saved for future reference or debugging purposes.\n6. **Model Information Files**: For each model, it generates an information file containing details about the model such as architecture, size, parameters, etc.\n7. **Running Models with Timeout**: Each model is run in a separate process with a specified timeout to prevent any single model from running indefinitely.\n8. **Performance Metrics Collection**: Performance metrics are collected during each model run, including total duration, load time, prompt evaluation counts and durations, and final evaluation counts and durations.\n9. **Detailed HTML Reports for Each Model**: For each model run, a detailed HTML report is generated containing the prompt, output, performance metrics, system stats, and model details.\n10. **Final Output Index Update**: After all models have been run, the main index file is updated to include links to the new reports and an overview of the current set of results.\n\nThis script is particularly useful for developers, researchers, or anyone who needs to compare the performance of multiple models on a consistent basis."
