This script is a comprehensive command-line tool for running language models using OLLAMA, managing the output, statistics, and indexing of results. Here's a breakdown of its functions:

1. **Setup**: Parses command-line arguments (`parseCommandLine`), sets up models and prompt, creates necessary directories (`createOutputDirectory`).

2. **Main Execution Loop**:
   - Iterates over each specified model.
   - Clears the model's output and statistics files.
   - Runs the OLLAMA model with the given prompt using `runModelWithTimeout`, which handles session timeout (configurable by `TIMEOUT` variable).
   - Updates system memory stats, OLLAMA and model statistics.
   - Generates HTML files for model output, statistics, models overview (`createModelsOverviewHtml`), and individual model index in results directory (`createOutputIndexHtml`).
   - Adds the model to the main run index (`createMainIndexHtml`).

3. **Finishing Touches**:
   - Ensures all processes are properly terminated (`finishOutputIndexHtml`).
   - Generates a full list of models used in all runs and their corresponding links, saved as `models.html` in the results directory.

4. **Statistics Collection**:
   - Collects and saves various statistics related to model run time (`setStats`), system memory usage (`setSystemStats`), OLLAMA details (`setOllamaStats`), and model properties (size, name, architecture, capabilities).

This script utilizes `ollama` as the underlying language processing engine, making it a powerful tool for running models and managing their output. The generated HTML files serve as an organized index and summary of results for further analysis or sharing.
