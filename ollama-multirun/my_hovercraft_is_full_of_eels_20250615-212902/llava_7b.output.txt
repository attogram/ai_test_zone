 This phrase is commonly used to describe a situation where something is filled with an excessive amount of a particular type of object, but in your case it seems like you're trying to make a pun or joke by combining the phrase with the idea of a hovercraft. However, it's not clear what you mean by "hovercraft" or how it relates to eels. Can you please provide more context or clarify your question?
