This is a classic! Itâ€™s a brilliant, nonsensical limerick thatâ€™s become a beloved internet meme. ðŸ˜„ 

It was famously said by Rowan Atkinson in the 1992 film *Bean*.

Is there anything youâ€™d like to do with this iconic phrase? Would you like to:

*   Tell me another version of the limerick?
*   Talk about the film *Bean*?
*   Just share the fun of it?
