We are going to write a function that takes an array as input and returns a string containing HTML for an unordered list.
 The function should handle both strings (for text content) and other types by converting them to strings using JSON.stringify or similar?
 However, note: if we use JSON.stringify on non-string values, it will convert arrays into [ ... ] format which might not be desired.

 We can assume the array contains only string elements? Or do we need a more generic approach?

 Let's clarify: 
 - The requirement is to output an HTML list of the array contents.
 - If the array has objects or other types, we want to display them in a way that makes sense. Maybe as their string representation?
   But note: for example, if we have [1, 2, 3] then using JSON.stringify would give ["1","2","3"] which is an array of strings.
   However, the requirement might be just to take each element and convert it to a string.

 Alternatively, we can make the function more robust by handling different types appropriately.

 But let's stick to the basic: if the input is an array of strings, then list them as <li>string</li>.
 If there are non-strings, we can use String() conversion or JSON.stringify? 

 Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll choose to convert each element to a string using `String()`.

 Steps:
 1. Check if input is an array.
 2. Map over the array and for each element, create an <li> tag with its string representation.
 3. Wrap the list in <ul>.

 Example: 
   Input: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
   Output: '<ul><li>apple</li><li>banana</li><li>cherry</li></ul>'

 However, note that if we are to output HTML and use it in a context where the string is inserted into an HTML document,
 then we must be cautious about escaping. But since this function returns HTML as a string (without rendering), and the user will
 handle inserting it, maybe they can escape themselves? Or perhaps not.

 Since the problem doesn't specify whether to escape or not, I'll assume that the array elements are safe for direct insertion.
 If we want to be strict about security when generating HTML, we should escape any special characters (like <, >, &, etc.) in each string.

 But again, let's stick to the requirement. The problem says "output a html list", so without escaping? 

 However, note that if the array comes from user input or an untrusted source, then not escaping can lead to XSS attacks.
 Since this is a code generation task and we don't know the context, I'll provide two options:

 Option 1: Without escaping (for simple cases where you trust the data)
 Option 2: With escaping

 Let me re-read the problem: it doesn't specify. So maybe just output as string without escaping? 

 But let's think about safety. If we are to use this function in a real HTML context, then we must escape.

 Since the requirement is ambiguous, I'll write two versions and comment on them.

 However, note that the user might want to insert the result into an existing HTML document. They will be responsible for escaping if needed?
 Actually, no: because when inserting raw HTML string, you don't escape it again in JavaScript (unless using innerText or similar). 

 So I think we should not escape by default? But let me check:

 The problem says "output a html list", meaning the function returns an HTML fragment. It is common to return unescaped HTML and then use
 textContent if inserting via JS, but note: sometimes people do want raw HTML.

 Alternatively, we can make it configurable. Let's see:

 We'll write two functions:
   - one that escapes (to be safe for arbitrary data)
   - one without escaping

 But the problem says to output a function. So maybe just one? 

 Since I don't know the context, I will assume that the user wants escaped HTML because it is safer.

 However, let's stick to the basic requirement and then add an escape option if we have time?

 Alternatively, we can do:

   function arrayToHtmlList(arr) {
     // Check input is array
     if (!Array.isArray(arr)) throw new Error("Input must be an array");

     // Escape each string: replace special characters with their HTML entities.
     const escapedItems = arr.map(item => item ? String(item).replace(/[&<>"']/g, escapeSpecialChars) : '');
     But wait, we don't know what the function is called from. Maybe let's create a helper for escaping.

   }

 However, note: if an array element is not a string or number (like object), then converting to string might give [object Object] and that's acceptable?
 Or maybe they want to avoid that? 

 Let me propose:

 We'll escape the following characters in each item when building the list:
   - & becomes &amp;
   - < becomes &lt;
   - > becomes &gt;
   - " becomes &quot;
   - ' becomes &#39;

 And we do this only if they are present? Because if not, then no need.

 But note: even numbers and booleans become strings. We want to escape them too because the string representation might contain special chars?

 Actually, let's consider that the function should handle any type by converting it to a string first (using String(item)), and then escape the resulting string.

 Steps for escaped version:

   1. Check input is array.
   2. Map over each item: convert to string and then replace special characters with their entities.
   3. Wrap in <ul> and map to create the list items.

 But note: what if an element is null or undefined? We can skip them or show "null" or "undefined"?

 Let's decide on behavior for non-string elements:

   - If we are using String(item), then null becomes empty string, undefined becomes "undefined", etc.
   - Then we escape that. So if the item was 123, it becomes "123". No problem.

 However, let me write a helper function to escape HTML special characters in a string:

   const escapeHtml = (str) => {
     return str.replace(/[&<>"']/g, 
        {'&': '&amp;', '<': '&lt;', '>': '&gt;', '\"': '&quot;', "'": '&#39;'});
   }

 But note: the regular expression /[&<>"']/g will match these characters. Then we can replace them one by one.

 Alternatively, we can use a function for replacement:

   const escapeHtml = (str) => {
     return str.replace(/[&<>"']/g, c => ({
         '&': '&amp;',
         '<': '&lt;',
         '>': '&gt;',
         '\"': '&quot;',
         "'": '&#39;'
     }[c]));
   }

 Now, let's write the function:

   function arrayToHtmlList(arr) {
     if (!Array.isArray(arr)) throw new Error("Input must be an array");

     const listItems = arr.map(item => `<li>${escapeHtml(String(item))}</li>`);

     return `<ul>${listItems.join('')}</ul>`;
   }

 But wait, what about the join? We are joining without any separator. That's okay because we want to output a string of <li> elements.

 However, note: if the array is empty, then we get an empty list but still have <ul></ul>. Is that acceptable?

 Let's test with an empty array:

   Input: []
   Output: '<ul><li></li></li>' ... no, wait: 
        arr.map(item => ...) returns [] for empty array.
        Then we do .join('') on the listItems -> still empty string.

   So output is <ul></ul>. That's acceptable because it represents an unordered list with zero items.

 But note: sometimes people might want to avoid empty lists? The problem doesn't specify, so let's keep it as is.

 Alternatively, we can return a safe HTML fragment even if the array has non-string elements by escaping appropriately.

 However, what about performance? We are doing two string conversions and then an escape for each element. 

 Considering that the requirement might be simple, but also to avoid XSS (which is important), I think this escaped version is better.

 But note: the problem doesn't specify whether to escape or not. So maybe we should ask?

 Since it's a code generation task, let me stick to the escaped version because it's safer and more general.

 However, if the user wants unescaped HTML (maybe they are using textContent in their own way), then they might prefer no escaping.

 We can make an option: 

   function arrayToHtmlList(arr, escape = true) {
     // ... same as above but conditionally escape
   }

 But again, the problem says to output a html list. So let's do:

   Without escaping first? Maybe because in some contexts you don't want to change the string.

 Alternatively, we can write two functions and then have one helper for escaping.

 Since I'm not sure, I'll provide both versions but with comments.

 But note: the problem says "Write a Javascript function", singular. So maybe just one?

 Let me assume that the user wants escaped HTML because it's safer to return properly escaped strings when generating HTML.

 However, if we are in a context where the array is entirely trusted (like our own data) then escaping might be overkill.

 We can leave an option for the user to choose? But let's keep it simple and just do one version that escapes.

 I think I'll go with the escaped version because generating HTML without escaping is dangerous.

 Now, what about newline characters or other string-specific issues?

 In the escape function, we are only replacing &, <, >, ", and '. What if there are newlines? We might want to preserve them by converting to `<br>` but that's beyond the scope.

 Let me stick to just those special characters for escaping because they break HTML structure.

 If the user wants more advanced formatting (like keeping line breaks) then we can do:

   const escapeHtml = (str) => {
     // Replace all occurrences of the special chars with their escaped versions.
     return str.replace(/[&<>"']/g, c => ({
         '&': '&amp;',
         '<': '&lt;',
         '>': '&gt;',
         '\"': '&quot;',
         "'": '&#39;'
     }[c]));
   }

 This function does exactly what we need.

 Now, let's write the main function:

   function arrayToHtmlList(arr) {
     if (!Array.isArray(arr)) throw new Error("Input must be an array");

     const list = arr.map(item => `<li>${escapeHtml(String(item))}</li>`).join('');
     return `<ul>${list}</ul>`;
   }

 But wait, what if the string contains a newline? We might want to replace it with <br> or leave as is?

 The problem doesn't specify. So let's not change that for now.

 Alternatively, we can note that in HTML, whitespace (including newlines) is collapsed unless explicitly declared. 
 If we are concerned about formatting, maybe the user should do it themselves? Or use a different method.

 We'll stick to just escaping the special characters and leave the rest as they are.

 Let me test with an array containing some of these:

   ['<script>alert("danger")</script>', '<', '>', '&', '"', "'"]

 Expected output for one element: 
   '<li>&lt;script&gt;alert(&amp;quot;danger&amp;quot;)&lt;/script&gt;</li>'

 But note: the entire list is built by joining these, so we must be cautious.

 However, let's code accordingly.

 We can also consider using a more robust escaping function that handles more cases? 

 I'll keep it simple for now.

 Final code with helper and main function:

   const escapeHtml = (str) => {
     return str.replace(/[&<>"']/g, c => ({
         '&': '&amp;',
         '<': '&lt;',
         '>': '&gt;',
         '\"': '&quot;',
         "'": '&#39;'
     }[c]));
   }

   function arrayToHtmlList(arr) {
     if (!Array.isArray(arr)) throw new Error("Input must be an array");
     return arr.map(item => `<li>${escapeHtml(String(item))}</li>`).join('').replace(/^/, '<ul>').replace(/$/, '</ul>');
   }

 Wait, the above is a bit messy. Let me rewrite:

   function arrayToHtmlList(arr) {
     if (!Array.isArray(arr)) throw new Error("Input must be an array");

     const listItems = arr.map(item => `<li>${escapeHtml(String(item))}</li>`);

     return `<ul>${listItems.join('')}</ul>`;
   }

 But note: what if the string has a < or >? It will break. We escape so it's safe.

 Alternatively, we can use DOMParser to create an element and then inspect its innerHTML without manual escaping? 
 However, that would be overkill for this simple function and might not cover all edge cases (like script tags) and is slower.

 Let me stick with the string replacement.

 But wait: what if the array has a lot of elements? Then we are creating many strings. This should be okay because it's just generating static HTML.

 Now, let's write the code accordingly.
