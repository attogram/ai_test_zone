The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering, in which shorter wavelengths of light (such as blue and violet) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (like red and orange) by the tiny molecules of gases in the atmosphere. This scattering effect is responsible for the blue color we observe during sunrise and sunset, as well as on clear days when the sky appears relatively cloudless.
