The blue color of the sky is due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Sunlight is composed of all colors. When sunlight enters the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, it collides with air molecules. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered more effectively than other colors. This scattered blue light is what we perceive when we look up at the sky.
