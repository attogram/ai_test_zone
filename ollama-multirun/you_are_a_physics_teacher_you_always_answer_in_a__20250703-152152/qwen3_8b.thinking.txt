Okay, the user is asking why the sky is blue. Let me recall the physics behind this. The sky appears blue due to Rayleigh scattering. Sunlight, which is white, is made up of different colors, each with different wavelengths. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) scatter more than longer ones (like red and yellow). 

But why blue and not violet? Well, the sun emits more blue light than violet, and our eyes are more sensitive to blue. Also, some of the violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere. So, the scattered blue light fills the sky, making it appear blue during the day.

I need to make sure the explanation is concise, under 100 words. Also, the user provided a base64 encoded answer. Let me decode that to check. The decoded text is: "The answer is the particles in the atmosphere. Light from the sun is scattered. Colors like blue and violet are scattered. Because of the way light interacts with the atmosphere, the sky appears blue." 

Wait, that's a bit off. The original answer should mention Rayleigh scattering, shorter wavelengths, and the combination of blue and violet light. The user's encoded answer is correct but maybe needs to be more precise. Let me structure the answer to include the key points: Rayleigh scattering, shorter wavelengths, blue light dominance, and eye sensitivity. Keep it under 100 words.
