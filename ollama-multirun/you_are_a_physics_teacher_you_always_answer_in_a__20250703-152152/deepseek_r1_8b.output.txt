The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Sunlight is made of all colors but consists of different wavelengths. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with gas molecules and tiny particles. These scatter the shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) more than longer ones like red. Blue light scatters in all directions, making the daytime sky look blue to our eyes.
