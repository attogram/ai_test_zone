The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight reaches the Earth's atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions by particles and molecules within the air (such as nitrogen and oxygen). Blue light waves are more easily scattered than longer wavelengths like red or orange. As these shorter wavelength lights disperse in every direction, they create a blue sky during daylight hours.
