The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This occurs when light from the sun passes through Earth's atmosphere and encounters molecules and particles in the air. The shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue, scatter more easily than longer wavelengths like red. As a result, we perceive the sky as blue during the day.
