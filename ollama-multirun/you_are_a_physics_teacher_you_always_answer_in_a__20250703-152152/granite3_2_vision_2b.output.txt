The sky appears blue due to a process called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it is scattered, or redirected, in all directions by the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels in smaller, shorter waves. This scattered blue light is what we see when we look up at the sky.
