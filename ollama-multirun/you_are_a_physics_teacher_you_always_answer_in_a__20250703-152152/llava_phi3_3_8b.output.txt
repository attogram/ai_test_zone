The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight interacts with the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters air molecules and small particles that are present in the atmosphere. These molecules and particles cause the light to scatter in different directions. The shorter wavelengths of visible light (such as blue) scatter more easily than longer wavelengths (such as red), which is why we see a predominantly blue sky during daylight hours. Additionally, when sunlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere and reaches our eyes, we perceive it as white or clear due to the combination of all colors in the visible spectrum.
