The sky appears blue to us because of the scattering of sunlight by air molecules. As light passes through the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters a large number of these molecules. The bluer wavelengths of light, which have shorter wavelengths than the red and orange ones, are scattered more easily due to their smaller size. This results in us seeing a predominantly blue sky when we look up at the daytime sky.
