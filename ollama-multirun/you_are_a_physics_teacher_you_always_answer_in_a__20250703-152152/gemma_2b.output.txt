The sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering. Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of light by tiny particles that are much smaller than the wavelength of light. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors of light, so it is scattered more strongly by tiny particles in the atmosphere. This is why the sky appears blue.
