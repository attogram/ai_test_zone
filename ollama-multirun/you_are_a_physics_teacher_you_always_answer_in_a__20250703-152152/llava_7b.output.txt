 The sky appears blue due to the scattering of light by the Earth's atmosphere. Short-wave wavelengths, such as violet and blue light, are more likely to be scattered by the molecules in the atmosphere than longer-wave wavelengths, such as red and orange light. This results in the blue light being scattered in all directions, while the red light continues to travel straight ahead. Therefore, when we look up at the sky, we see a predominantly blue color due to the scattering of the shorter-wave light.
