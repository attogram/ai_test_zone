Okay, the user is asking why the sky is blue. I need to explain this in 100 words or less, seriously. Let me recall the physics behind it.

The sky appears blue because of Rayleigh scattering. Sunlight is made of different colors, each with their own wavelength. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors, so it scatters more in the atmosphere. When the scattered light reaches our eyes, it's the blue color we see. But wait, the answer should be concise. Also, the user provided a code snippet, maybe a cipher? But the question is about the sky's color. Let me focus on the physics.

I need to mention Rayleigh scattering, the role of shorter wavelengths, and why blue is predominant. Keep it simple and to the point. Make sure it's under 100 words. Check for clarity and correctness. Avoid any markdown. Alright, let's put it all together.
