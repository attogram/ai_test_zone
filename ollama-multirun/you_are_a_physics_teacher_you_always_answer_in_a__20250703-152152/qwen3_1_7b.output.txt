The sky appears blue due to Rayleigh scattering, a phenomenon where shorter wavelengths of light (like blue) scatter more efficiently in the Earth's atmosphere. Sunlight, composed of various colors, interacts with atmospheric molecules, and blue light, with its shorter wavelength, is scattered in all directions. This scattered light reaches our eyes, predominantly in the blue spectrum, creating the familiar blue sky. The effect is most pronounced near the horizon, where light travels through more atmosphere, enhancing the scattering. This explanation adheres to scientific principles without redundancy.
