Okay, the user said "hi" first, and I need to respond. Let me think about the appropriate way to respond. Since they started with a greeting, it's best to acknowledge it and offer assistance. Maybe say something like, "Hi! How can I assist you today?" That's friendly and opens the door for further interaction. I should also keep the tone positive and helpful. Let me make sure there's no confusion, like if they're testing me or just chatting. Alright, that should cover it.
