Okay, the user just said “hi” with a simple lowercase. Hmm, seems like they're starting a conversation casually—maybe testing how I respond or just greeting me without much context yet.

The tone feels neutral but friendly given it's an opener. Could be someone new checking if I'm awake and online, or maybe returning users being polite. Since there's no specific request here, keeping the reply warm and open-ended makes sense to encourage engagement while staying approachable.

I wonder if they're in a hurry or just starting their day. The minimalism might mean they prefer directness later too—so I'll keep this response light but ready for follow-ups that could be more complex. No need to dive deep yet unless they ask.
