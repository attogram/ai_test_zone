```
function list_to_html() {
    local -n arr=$1 # "local -n" allows us to pass the array by reference
    local html="<ul>"

    for i in "${arr[@]}"; do
        html+="<li>${i}</li>"
    done

    html+="</ul>"

    echo "$html"
}
```
This function takes an array as its first argument, and outputs a HTML list of the array contents. The `local -n` syntax allows us to pass the array by reference, so that we can modify the original array within the function without affecting the caller's copy of the array.
