Here is an example Bash function that takes in an array as input and outputs its elements as an HTML unordered list:
```
#!/bin/bash
# Function to convert an array into an HTML unordered list
function array_to_html_list() {
  # Convert the array into a string with comma-separated values, enclosed within <ul> tags
  echo "<ul>" "$1" "</ul>"
}
# Example usage: 
arr=(apple banana cherry)
echo "Array contents as an HTML unordered list:"
array_to_html_list "${arr[@]}"
```
This function uses `@` to access all elements of the array and pass them as arguments, which are then converted into a string with comma-separated values. The resulting string is enclosed within `<ul>` tags.
Note: This will only work if you have an array named `$arr` whose contents can be accessed via `${arr[@]}` notation in Bash.
You may also want to use the `set -o errexit` option for better error handling, and make sure that all variables are properly defined before being used.
