To read and parse the two text files, `stats.txt` and `show.txt`, into bash variables, we can use a combination of loops, string manipulation, and built-in shell utilities like `awk`, `grep`, or `IFS` (Internal Field Separator).

First, let's create two functions in our script: `parse_stats.sh` and `parse_show.sh`. Each function will read their respective file, parse the content into variables, and then return them.

Here is a sample implementation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to parse stats.txt
parse_stats() {
    # Clear IFS so we can split on any whitespace by default
    IFS=' '
    
    # Read in the stats file line by line using a while loop
    while read -r name value; do
        # Set the variable with the name and value from each line
        declare "$name=${value}"
    done < stats.txt
    
    # Print all variables for verification purposes
    printf "\n%-20s %-10s\n" "Name" "Value"
    print_vars()
}

# Function to parse show.txt
parse_show() {
    # Clear IFS so we can split on any whitespace by default
    IFS=' '
    
    section=""
    while read -r line; do
        if [[ $line == Model* ]]; then
            section="Model"
        elif [[ $line == Capabilities* ]]; then
            section="Capabilities"
        elif [[ $line == Parameters* ]]; then
            section="Parameters"
        else
            continue
        fi
        
        # Process the remaining lines of this section until we reach another section or the end of the file
        while true; do
            read -r line || break
            
            if [[ ${line:0:1} == *'#'* ]]; then
                break  # If a comment is found, exit the current loop
            elif [[ $section == Model* ]]; then
                # For the Model section, we split on whitespace and take the second value (assuming that's where the description starts)
                IFS=' ' read -r _ model_info <<< "$line"
                echo "Model Info: ${model_info##*[![:space:]]}"
                
            elif [[ $section == Parameters* ]]; then
                # For the Parameters section, we split on whitespace and assign the first value to a variable (assuming that's where the name starts)
                IFS=' ' read -r param_name param_value <<< "$line"
                declare "$param_name=${param_value}"
                
            else  # Capabilities section
                echo "Capability: $line"
            fi
            
        done | while IFS= read -r capability; do
            echo "Capability: $capability"
        done << <EOF

# Call the functions to parse and print the contents of the files
parse_stats
parse_show < show.txt
```

This script should be saved as `main.sh`, and it will read in each file, parse the content into bash variables, and then display them. The parsing logic assumes that the format is strictly followed for each section (Model, Capabilities, Parameters), which may not always be reliable.

Please note that this is a simplified example to give you an idea of how you can approach the problem. Depending on the actual contents of your files, the specific parsing logic might need adjustments. For instance, if the sections are not clearly marked as shown in your examples (i.e., they don't start with "Model", "Capabilities", and "Parameters"), then you'd have to adjust the code accordingly.

Also, be cautious when using variables from untrusted sources since `read` without `-r` can cause word splitting and globbing, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. Always use `-r` when reading files to prevent these issues.
