 This phrase, "My hovercraft is full of eels," comes from a Monty Python sketch and has become an inside joke among fans. It's often used to suggest that someone or something is excessively full or loaded with something, even if it seems unlikely or impossible.

In the context of your question, it could be interpreted as saying that your hovercraft (if you have one) is filled to capacity with eels. However, since hovercrafts are not commonly used for transporting live animals like eels, this statement is likely just a playful way of expressing a sense of being overwhelmed or overloaded.
