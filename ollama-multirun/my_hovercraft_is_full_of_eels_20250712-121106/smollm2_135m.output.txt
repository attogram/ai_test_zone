Your ship has indeed received its share of friendly creatures. I'd like to suggest a solution: your boat could have some extra equipment for maximum efficiency and agility in tight spots. You may also consider investing in some more advanced navigation systems, such as radar or sonar, to keep an eye out for potential threats.

Another option is to create a system of hidden compartments within the hull that can be easily accessed by other ships. Perhaps you could even incorporate some clever hiding places, like secret passages or hidden passageways, which would give you valuable information about your surroundings and allow you to observe the surrounding environment from afar.

A more practical solution might involve using advanced AI systems to analyze the situation in real-time, giving you an early warning system when the eels are approaching or preparing for a potential attack. This could be achieved through machine learning algorithms that can learn from data and adapt their responses accordingly.

Lastly, consider adding some innovative materials or technologies to your hull, like advanced insulation or enhanced thermal mass, which would help keep your ship warm in extreme temperatures while also keeping eels at bay.

What do you think? Would any of these ideas resonate with you, or are there other directions you'd like to explore?
