This appears to be a reference or joke about the children's TV show "Thomas and Friends," specifically an episode where Thomas, the steam engine, goes on a journey with his friends. One of the characters in that episode mentions having a hovercraft full of eels.

So in this context, it would be more like:

"Thomas, my hovercraft is full of eels..."

I'm not sure if you meant something else by your message, but this seems to be referencing a specific children's show. Let me know if I misunderstood anything!
