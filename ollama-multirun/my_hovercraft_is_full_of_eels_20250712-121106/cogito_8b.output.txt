That's a great reference to the 1993 British film "The Full Monty" - one of my favorite scenes! The line "My hovercraft is full of eels" (or sometimes translated as "prawns") is spoken by a character when someone asks why he's looking at his watch. It's a memorable moment in the film that has become quite iconic.

Would you like to discuss more about this movie or perhaps talk about hovercrafts and their uses?
