Oh no, that’s *so* bizarre! A hovercraft (a vehicle that floats on a cushion of gas) and eels (aquatic, slimy, and not designed to fly)… this is a classic mix-up! 🐠✈️  

Maybe you’re playing with words? Like, are you referring to a *hoverboard* (a small electric vehicle that glides on air) or a *hovercraft* (a more advanced, heavier machine)? If it’s a metaphor, maybe you’re saying something like:  
- "My hoverboard is full of eels!"  
- "My hovercraft is full of eels!" (But eels don’t fly… unless you’re in a *hovercraft* made of jellyfish or something!)  

If it’s a joke, just laugh it off! Eels are cool, but they’re not suited for flight. Maybe you’re imagining a sci-fi scenario? Let me know, and I can help you make it clearer! 🐠😄
