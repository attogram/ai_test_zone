It seems like you're describing a hover craft filled with eels, which sounds really cool and fun! If you're having trouble getting the hover craft to work properly, or if it's not doing what you expect, there are several things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. **Check the Battery:** The hover craft likely depends on a battery for power. Make sure your battery is fully charged and that the power cord is plugged into the correct circuit. If the power isn't working, unplug it temporarily.

2. **Adjust the Hover Craft Settings:** On most hover craft controllers or software, you can adjust settings like altitude, speed, and orientation to improve control. Look for a "Settings" or "Controls" button in your software. Experiment with different settings to see if they help stabilize the hover craft.

3. **Test the Harp (If Available):** If your hover craft comes with an harp (a type of remote-like device), try testing it out before trying to fly using the power cord. This can give you a feel for how the hover craft responds to electrical signals and help fine-tune its movements.

4. **Look for Gels in Your Eel Material:** If your hover craft is made from eel material, there may be gels or stabilizing agents inside the hover craft. These can sometimes interfere with control systems. Try gently tilting the hover craft to see if it helps separate the gels and improve stability.

5. **Use a Different Power Source:** If your power cord is causing issues, consider using an AC power source instead of the DC power from the cord. Some hover crafts are designed to operate on alternating current (AC) power, which might be more reliable for movement.

6. **Consult the User Guide or Support:** If you're still having trouble after trying these steps, consult the user manual that came with your hover craft or look for technical support online. There may be specific instructions or troubleshooting guides tailored to your particular model.

7. **Ask for Help:** If none of these solutions work, don't hesitate to ask for help from a friend, family member, or online community forums. Sometimes a fresh pair of eyes can spot issues you might have missed.

Filing down the eels themselves is not recommended and could potentially damage your hover craft! Have fun with your hover craft and enjoy those eel-filled rides! ðŸ˜Š
