Thinking...
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if Socrates is mortal based on the given premises. The premises are that Socrates is a human, and all humans are mortal. Hmm.

First, I need to recall some basic logic here. The first premise is straightforward: Socrates is a human. The second premise is a universal statement: All humans are mortal. So, if all humans are mortal, then any individual human should also be mortal. But wait, is that exactly how logic works?

In formal logic, if we have a universal statement "All A are B," then any specific instance of A must be B. So, if Socrates is a human (A), then Socrates must be mortal (B). So, applying modus ponens here. The structure would be: If all A are B, then Socrates is A, therefore Socrates is B. That seems right.

But maybe I need to check if there's any exception. The premises don't mention any exceptions. They just state that all humans are mortal. So, unless there's a hidden premise that Socrates is not a human, which isn't the case here, the conclusion should hold.

Wait, but in real life, Socrates was indeed mortal. He died, so the premises are consistent with that. But the question is purely logical. The answer would be yes, based on the given premises. However, the user might be testing if I can apply logical reasoning properly, not just recall real-world facts.

Another angle: Could there be a case where "all humans are mortal" doesn't apply? Like, if there's a special category of humans that aren't mortal? But the premises don't mention that. So, the conclusion follows directly from the premises.

So, the answer should be yes, Socrates is mortal based on the given premises. But I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe the question is a trick question, but the premises are straightforward. No, I think it's a simple application of logic.
...done thinking.

Based on the given premises:

1. **Socrates is a human**  
2. **All humans are mortal**  

The logical structure is a **universal affirmative statement** ("All humans are mortal") applied to a specific instance ("Socrates is a human"). This is a classic example of **modus ponens**, where if all members of a category (humans) share a property (mortality), then any member of the category (Socrates) must also share that property.  

**Conclusion:**  
Socrates is mortal.  

This follows directly from the premises, as there are no exceptions or additional constraints provided. The reasoning is valid and consistent with classical logic.
