The question is about the hypothetical relationship between Socrates and being mortal. 

**Here's how the different statements interact:**

* **Socrates is a human:** This is a factual statement.
* **All humans are mortal:** This statement is also factual.
* **Is Socrates mortal?** This question is a hypothetical, asking whether Socrates is one of the mortal beings.

**The answer depends on the interpretation of the terms:**

* **Mortal:** This term has different meanings depending on the context. In this case, it refers to living beings, which excludes Socrates, who is a non-living entity.
* **Socrates is a human:** This statement is clear and straightforward.
* **Is Socrates mortal?** This question is about the hypothetical existence of Socrates and whether he fits the definition of mortal.

**Therefore, the answer to the question depends on the interpretation of the word "mortal" and whether Socrates can be considered a human in that context.**

Here are some additional perspectives on the question:

* **Socrates is not a human in the conventional sense:** He is an idealized being representing the pursuit of truth and wisdom.
* **Socrates' immortality could be argued from his unchanging wisdom:** If Socrates is eternally seeking truth, it could be argued that he transcends the natural limitations of mortal existence.
* **The question could also be interpreted from different philosophical perspectives:** Some argue that the definition of "mortal" is fluid and includes entities like Socrates. Others argue that Socrates is inherently different from humans due to his non-biological nature.

Ultimately, the answer to this question is open to interpretation and depends on the individual's beliefs and values.
