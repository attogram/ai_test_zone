Thinking...
Okay, so I need to figure out if Socrates is mortal based on the given premises. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the first premise states that Socrates is a human. That's straightforwardâ€”Socrates belongs to the category of humans. Now, the second premise says that all humans are mortal. So, since humans include Socrates, that means everyone in that group must be mortal. Therefore, logically, if all humans are mortal and Socrates is a human, then it necessarily follows that Socrates is mortal.

Wait, but I'm wondering, do these premises cover every aspect of being human? Maybe there's something about Socrates that isn't covered here. But from what I know, the classic argument is based on general categories: human, all humans are mortal. So, unless there's a specific reason to doubt one of these premises, like maybe some people don't consider Socrates a human or aren't sure about their mortality, then it should hold.

I guess another angle is whether Socrates could exist without being mortal. But since the premises don't provide any exceptions or exceptions that would make Socrates not mortal, they support the conclusion that he must be mortal.
...done thinking.

Based on the given premises, Socrates is a human and all humans are mortal. Therefore, it logically follows that Socrates is mortal.

**Answer:** Yes, based on the premises provided, Socrates is mortal.
