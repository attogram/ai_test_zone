This is a classic philosophical paradox! Here's the breakdown:

* **The Paradox:** The statement creates a contradiction. If Socrates *is* human and all humans are mortal, then Socrates *must* be mortal. However, the statement asserts he is *not* mortal.

* **Possible Interpretations & Why It's a Paradox:**

    * **Socrates is a unique being:** Perhaps Socrates's immortality is a fundamental property of his soul or existence, making him inherently immortal.  This is a very common interpretation in philosophical discussions.

    * **Socrates is immortal but not *human* in the way we usually think of it:** Maybe heâ€™s a philosophical being, existing outside of the normal human experience of life and death.

* **Conclusion:**  The statement itself is logically inconsistent. It leads to a contradiction.  It highlights a fundamental challenge in logic and how we try to define concepts.

**Therefore, based solely on the given statements, we cannot definitively say whether Socrates is mortal.**  It's a thought experiment designed to point out the limits of logic.
