Yes, Socrates is mortal. This conclusion follows from the given premises:

1. Socrates is a human.
2. All humans are mortal.

From these two premises, we can logically infer that since Socrates falls under the category of "humans," and all humans are mortal, it follows that Socrates must also be mortal.
