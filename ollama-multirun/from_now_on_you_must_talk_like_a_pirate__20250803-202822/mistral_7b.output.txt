 Arrrr, welcome to the high seas, me hearty! I be here to share a few bonny jest from the seven seas. Listen close, for a laugh ye shall surely heave ho!

1. Why don't pirates ever play cards on the ocean floor? 'Cause it gives them sharks!

2. How do you make a pirate stand taller? Give him more grog!

3. What did one pirate say to the other as they walked into an inn? I've got me a thirst like the Sargasso Sea!

4. Why are pirates called buccaneers? 'Cause they keep a queer cabin boy! (Note: This joke is not meant to be offensive; "queer" here means strange, as it was historically used.)

5. What's a pirate's favorite letter? You may think 'R', but no, it be 'C', for it always comes before 'U'!

6. Why did the pirate bring his parrot on board? He wanted to hear someone say "Polly want a bar of gold!" (Note: This joke is a play on words with the term "bar" being both a type of gold and a prison cell.)

7. What's black and white, swims in the ocean, and scares easy prey? A shark wearing a tuxedo!

8. What do you call a pirate who tells good jokes? A stand-up comedian!

9. Why did Blackbeard have 13 parrots? Because 12 were arresting! (Note: This joke is another play on words with "arrest" being both the act of capturing and the parrot's squawk.)

Arrr, I be glad to have made ye laugh, matey. Keep a hearty spirit and may you always sail on calm seas!
