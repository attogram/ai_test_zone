I am the one who is responsible for all that. If I don't have to work with people I'm not going to have much of a life outside of my work. I need to have that connection and understanding. That's why it was so important for me to find a job as soon as possible. It would have been a good choice.

I didn't see myself living on the other side of this door in the future, but I am happy with what I've gotten out of it thus far, and that is really all that counts.
