This is a classic philosophical thought experiment! Here's the breakdown:

* **Socrates is a human.** This is a factual statement.
* **All humans are mortal.** This is also a factual statement.

**Therefore, yes, Socrates is mortal.**

However, this doesn't answer the question of *why* he's mortal. Socratesâ€™s mortality is a matter of speculation and philosophical inquiry, not a simple logical deduction.

**The core of the issue is the definition of "mortal."**  The statement relies on a very specific definition. But the question asks if *anyone* is mortal, which is a more open question.
