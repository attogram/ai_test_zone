Okay, so I need to figure out whether Socrates is mortal based on the given statements. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the statement says, "Socrates is a human." That means Socrates belongs to the category of humans. Now, the next part is, "All humans are mortal." So if every individual who is a human must be mortal, then since Socrates is a human, he should be mortal.

I think about syllogisms here. The first premise is a simple assertion that Socrates is in a certain category (humans). The second premise states a general rule about all members of that category (all humans are mortal). Combining these two gives us the conclusion that Socrates, being a human, must be mortal.

I don't see any exceptions or counterexamples here. All humans share this characteristic, so it holds true universally. Therefore, I can confidently say that Socrates is mortal.
