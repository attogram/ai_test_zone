**Answer:**  
Yes, Socrates is mortal.  

**Reasoning:**  
1. **Premise 1:** "Socrates is a human."  
2. **Premise 2:** "All humans are mortal."  
3. **Logical Conclusion:** Since Socrates is a human (Premise 1) and all humans are mortal (Premise 2), it follows that Socrates is mortal. This is a valid syllogism (a form of deductive reasoning) where the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.  

Thus, based on the given premises, **Socrates is mortal**.
