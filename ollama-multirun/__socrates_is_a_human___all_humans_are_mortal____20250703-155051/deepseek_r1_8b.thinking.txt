First, the user says: "Socrates is a human." That's given as a fact.

Then: "All humans are mortal." This is another statement that defines what it means to be human in this context; all humans have mortality.

Finally: "Is Socrates mortal?"

I need to reason step by step. Since Socrates is a human and all humans are mortal, then Socrates must be mortal.

This seems like a classic syllogism:

Premise 1: All humans are mortal.

Premise 2: Socrates is a human.

Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

The user might be testing if I can handle this logical reasoning. It's straightforward and based on given premises.

I should respond clearly and directly. No need for complications; just state the conclusion based on the information provided.

But let me make sure there are no tricks. The user didn't say anything else, so it's purely logic-based.

Also, I'm an AI, so I can use my knowledge to confirm this. Socrates was a famous philosopher from ancient Greece, and history shows that he died, but even without that, the premises should lead to the conclusion.

The response should be helpful and engaging. Since this is a simple question, keep it concise.

Possible responses:

- Yes, because all humans are mortal and Socrates is human.
- Logically, yes, based on the syllogism.
- Just answer "Yes" with a brief explanation.

But I should provide reasoning to show how I arrived at that conclusion, as per my design.

The user said: "- Socrates is a human. - All humans are mortal. - Is Socrates mortal?"

It's presented in a list format, so perhaps they want me to treat it as input and output accordingly.

I can structure my response similarly:

- Restate the premises.
- Give the answer.
- Optionally, explain briefly if needed.
