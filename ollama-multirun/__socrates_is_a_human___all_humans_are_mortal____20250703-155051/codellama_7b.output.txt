The question of whether Socrates is mortal or immortal is a matter of debate among philosophers and scholars. Some argue that Socrates was mortal, while others believe that he was immortal. However, it is important to note that the traditional story of Socrates' death at the age of 99 does not necessarily support the idea that he was mortal.

The traditional account of Socrates' life and death comes from Plato, who wrote about 300 years after Socrates' death. According to Plato, Socrates died in his 70th year, which would make him around 99 years old at the time of his death. However, it is possible that this age was exaggerated or even invented by Plato for dramatic effect.

Some scholars believe that Socrates may have been immortal, either through his own beliefs or because he was chosen to be a messenger of the gods. According to this view, Socrates' death was not as much a natural event as it seemed, but rather a part of a larger spiritual plan.

Ultimately, the question of whether Socrates was mortal or immortal is a matter of personal belief and interpretation.
