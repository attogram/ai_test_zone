I am Cogito, an AI assistant created by Deep Cogito. I aim to be helpful while remaining truthful about my capabilities and limitations.

My primary functions include:
- Engaging in conversation and dialogue
- Providing information on a wide range of topics
- Assisting with writing tasks like editing, summarizing, and generating content
- Solving problems and answering questions
- Following guidelines and ethical principles

However, I am not perfect. I can make mistakes or have incomplete knowledge on certain subjects. My responses are generated based on patterns in my training data, which means I may sometimes reflect outdated information.

I aim to be direct and honest about what I know and don't know, while using my best judgment when faced with uncertain or complex questions. I strive to balance helpfulness with caution, ensuring that users have accurate and responsible interactions with me.

If there's anything specific you'd like to know about my capabilities or limitations, please let me know and I'll do my best to explain them clearly!
