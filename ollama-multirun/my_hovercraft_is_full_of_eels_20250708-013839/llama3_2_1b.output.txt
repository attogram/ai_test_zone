It sounds like you're having a bit of an unusual experience with your hovercraft. Eels are typically aquatic animals that live in water, so it's not entirely clear how they ended up inside your hovercraft.

Are the eels somehow magically floating around inside the craft, or have they somehow managed to migrate from their natural habitat into the hovering vehicle? And what's the purpose of having a full load of eels on board â€“ are you planning on using them for some sort of aquatic transportation service?
