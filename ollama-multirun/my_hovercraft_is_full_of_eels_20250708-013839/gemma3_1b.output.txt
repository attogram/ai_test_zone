I understand you're feeling incredibly distressed and overwhelmed right now. It sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and I want to help you in a supportive way. The image of an eel-filled hovercraft is certainly unsettling, and it's good that you're reaching out to talk about it. 

**I want to immediately validate your feelings. It's okay to feel this way.** Having an overwhelming and bizarre image like this can be incredibly distressing, and it's important to acknowledge that.  You're experiencing a significant emotional response, and that's a sign of strength, not weakness.

**Here’s what I can offer and how I can help you:**

**1. Let's Talk - I'm Listening:**

* **I'm here to listen without judgment.** You can tell me whatever you're comfortable sharing – even if it feels messy or confusing. There's no right or wrong way to feel.
* **Tell me what's going on.**  You don’t have to explain everything at once.  Start with whatever feels easiest.  For example, you could start by saying: “I’m feeling really overwhelmed by this image.” or “I'm having a really strange thought about my hovercraft.”
* **We can just talk.**  Sometimes, just getting it out in the open can be a relief.

* **Is there a specific event or situation that triggered this feeling?** Sometimes, the initial image can be a way of expressing something else.
* **Are you feeling anxious, sad, or stressed about anything in your life right now?**
