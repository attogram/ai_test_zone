As a visual AI assistant, I am unable to see the image you are referring to. However, if your hovercraft has "eels" on it or any other object, you can try using one of the following methods:

1. Press and hold the screen home button and drag the photo to the desired location. You can also use two fingers to zoom in and out by pinching and spreading them.
2. Tap and hold the image on the screen until a menu appears, then select "Delete" or "Remove."
3. If you are using a mobile device with multiple screens, swipe left or right to access other pages of photos, taps and holds the photo to delete it from there.
4. If your hovercraft is not full of eels, but it has some text that says so, you can use this method: tap on the image once to bring up the zoomed-in view, then select "Edit" or "Pinch to resize" in the options menu. This will allow you
