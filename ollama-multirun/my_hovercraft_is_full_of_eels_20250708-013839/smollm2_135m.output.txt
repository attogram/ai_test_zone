(sighing) Ah, a good day in the surf! (laughs) Well, it's not exactly a "good" day. Eels can be a bit finicky for this kinda thing... but I've got a few tricks up my sleeve to help me get through it.

First things first, we'll start with the engines and the ballast tanks. We have to make sure they're both in good shape and that all the propellers are moving smoothly. (laughs) But what really helps is having some patience! Not too long ago, I remember getting caught up in a whirlwind of eels while attempting to ride out an offshore storm.

Now, let's talk about the materials. We'll be using a mix of fiberglass and carbon fiber to give it a bit more structure, but nothing that'll stand up to the rough seas we'll be dealing with. And don't even get me started on the pumps! (smiling wistfully) It's not like I've ever seen anything quite like this before...

Lastly, let's not forget about those eels themselves! (laughs) We're talking about some of the biggest fish in the sea, and they might just be more intimidating than we anticipated.

(pausing, looking at you with a serious expression) Ah, but don't get too excited just yet. I've got a few tricks up my sleeve to make sure everything goes smoothly. And if all that isn't enough, let me tell you something: the eels might even be more than just harmless! (eyes lighting up with anticipation)
