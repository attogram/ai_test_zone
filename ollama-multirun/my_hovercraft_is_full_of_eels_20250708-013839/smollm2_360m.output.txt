I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an NLP assistant designed to help with natural language processing tasks, I don't have the capability to interact with physical objects or control real-world systems. While I can understand and respond to text messages, emails, and voice queries, I am not programmed to assist with specific equipment like hovercrafts or any other technical devices.
