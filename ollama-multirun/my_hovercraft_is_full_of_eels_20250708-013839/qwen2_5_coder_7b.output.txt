That sounds like quite an unusual and interesting situation! Hovercrafts are usually used for transportation over water, but if you're carrying eels on your hovercraft, it might be a bit tricky to navigate the waters around your destination. Eels can be delicate creatures and may not survive well in transit. If you're planning on transporting eels, make sure to handle them carefully and provide them with adequate space and oxygen. It's also important to check any regulations or restrictions on transportation of live animals in your area.
