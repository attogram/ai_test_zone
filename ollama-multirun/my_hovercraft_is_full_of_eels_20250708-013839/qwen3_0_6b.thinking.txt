Okay, the user mentioned they have a hovercraft full of eels. First, I need to understand what they mean by that. Maybe they're referring to their personal belongings, like eels as a symbol or a metaphor. But I should acknowledge that it's a bit unclear. I should respond in a way that's supportive, maybe by asking for more details. It's important to keep the tone friendly and open for further information. Also, make sure not to use any markdown and keep the response natural. Let me check for any other possible interpretations and confirm that the user wants to share more about their hovercraft or the eels in it.
