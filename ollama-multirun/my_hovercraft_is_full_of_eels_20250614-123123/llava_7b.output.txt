 I'm sorry, but the phrase "My hovercraft is full of eels" is a famous line from the film The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It is spoken by Arthur Dent as he watches his home planet being destroyed by the Vogons. In reality, it would be difficult for a hovercraft to be full of eels since they are small aquatic creatures and not capable of filling the large compartment of a hovercraft.
