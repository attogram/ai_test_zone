Congratulations! You have successfully captured a hoard of mischievous eels in your trusty hovercraft. Here's what you can do with them:

1. Use the Eel-Rod to reel in the eels and store them safely onboard for later use. Be careful not to get electrocuted by their slippery, electric jolts!
2. Utilize your hovercraft's advanced navigation system to navigate through treacherous waters filled with seaweed and underwater caves.
3. Keep an eye out for hidden eel nests in the ocean depths, which may contain valuable ingredients such as rare algae or precious metals used by marine creatures.
4. Involve your eels in epic battles against sea monsters like krakens and giant squids, using their shock-inducing powers to weaken and defeat them before launching a final attack with your hovercraft's weapons.
5. With the help of your loyal band of aquatic friends - including fish and crustaceans - set out on an adventure to locate and rescue other captured eels from nefarious villains, all while avoiding treacherous ocean currents and underwater obstacles.
6. Once you have successfully rescued the eels, return them to their natural habitat in the coral reefs or deep-sea trenches, where they can continue to thrive and create more powerful shockwaves to aid you on your next quest!
