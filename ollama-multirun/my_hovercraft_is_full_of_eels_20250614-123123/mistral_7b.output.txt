 That's a reference to Douglas Adams' "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," where that phrase was used humorously. The book is a science fiction comedy series that satirizes various aspects of philosophy, science, and culture. It's known for its witty humor and unconventional storytelling. If you enjoy it, I would recommend checking out the other books in the series or watching the TV adaptations.
