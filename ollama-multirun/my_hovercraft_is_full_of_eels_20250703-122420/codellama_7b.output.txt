 It seems like you're trying to describe a situation where your hovercraft is full of eels. However, the phrase "It's my hovercraft" doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence you provided. Additionally, the statement "It's my hovercraft" doesn't provide any information about the contents of the hovercraft.

 If you meant to say that your hovercraft is full of eels, you could rephrase the sentence as: "My hovercraft is full of eels." This would be a more clear and concise way of expressing the idea.
