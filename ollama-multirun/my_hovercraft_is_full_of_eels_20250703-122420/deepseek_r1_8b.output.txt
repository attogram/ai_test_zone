Oh, wow! Is that an actual quote from *Red Dwarf*? Or are you just riffing on Douglas Adams' "my life is full of eels" thing?

A hovercraft full of eels sounds like it could be a recipe for disasterâ€”both literally and figuratively. Eels might wiggle their way out, short-circuit the whole thing with slime, or maybe they'd rather explore by swimming than floating? ðŸ˜„

If you're looking to vent about something technical (like engineering challenges), I can help brainstorm! Or if it's just a fun nod to sci-fi absurdity, let's keep it light. What's up with this hovercraft dilemma?
