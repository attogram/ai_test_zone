That's a line from Monty Python's "Search for the Holy Grail" sketch "The Dead Parrot". It means you're in a humorous situation! However, if you're asking about a real-life hovercraft filled with eels, that wouldn't make practical sense. Hovercrafts are airborne vehicles that float on a cushion of air, and they don't typically carry live animals, especially eels.
