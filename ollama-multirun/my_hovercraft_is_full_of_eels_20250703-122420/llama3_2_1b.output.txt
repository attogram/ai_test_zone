That's an... interesting situation. If your hovercraft is filled with eels, I'm assuming they're not in distress or harm and are just peacefully coexisting inside.

Have you considered finding a way to safely release the eels into their natural habitat? Perhaps there's a nearby aquarium or a wildlife sanctuary that would be happy to take them in?

If not, you might need to think about how to get your hovercraft clean and eel-free. Some eels can carry diseases or parasites that could harm other aquatic creatures.

Are you a professional eel wrangler or just a hobbyist?
