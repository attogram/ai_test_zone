It seems like you're describing a playful or fictional scenario, perhaps from a children's story or a creative story. In a real-world context, if your hovercraft is designed to collect eels (a type of fish), it would likely be a specialized craft or technology rather than something common. Eel collection in hovercrafts could involve advanced engineering, such as propellers for speed and buoyancy for stability, combined with systems to capture eels effectively.

If you're looking for a fun, imaginative scenario, you might want to explore how such a hovercraft would function or imagine the elements of the story. Let me know if you'd like help with that! üêæ
