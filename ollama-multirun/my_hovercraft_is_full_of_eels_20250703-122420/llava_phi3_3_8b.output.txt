Eels are a type of fish that live in freshwater or saltwater. They have elongated bodies and produce electric shocks for defense and navigation. While it is possible to transport eels as pets, it is not advisable due to their unique needs and potential harm they could cause to the environment if released into non-native habitats. If you need assistance with relocating your eels or have any questions about proper care, I recommend consulting a professional animal trainer or aquarium expert.
