A classic phrase! "My hovercraft is full of eels" is a famous example of an "apology sentence," which are humorous phrases that explain or apologize for something, often in an absurd way. The original sentence from Douglas Adams' science fiction radio series "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" goes like this: "My hovercraft is full of elephants." However, it seems you're following in his footsteps by adding eels to the mix! What a fin-tastic twist on a classic phrase! Would you like me to come up with more eel-themed puns?
