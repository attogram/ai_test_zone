This is a classic, delightfully absurd phrase! It's a famous line from the British comedy sketch show "The Frost Report" (1982). 

The full line is: "My hovercraft is full of eels." It's delivered with a completely straight face by Mike Smith, and itâ€™s become a beloved bit of British comedy lore.

Do you want to:

*   **Learn more about the sketch?** I can tell you more about its history and how it became famous.
*   **Just appreciate the silliness?** (Which is perfectly valid!)
