It seems like you've provided a string of characters in different languages, including Latin and Cyrillic scripts. I'll interpret the text as English (Latin script) and provide an answer accordingly:

"How does artificial intelligence work? Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves creating machines or software that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. This includes learning from data, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and understanding natural language processing. AI systems use algorithms and statistical models to improve their performance over time through machine learning techniques like supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. AI applications span various domains such as speech recognition, image analysis, decision-making, and more."

If you meant a different language or topic, please provide more context or clarify your question!
