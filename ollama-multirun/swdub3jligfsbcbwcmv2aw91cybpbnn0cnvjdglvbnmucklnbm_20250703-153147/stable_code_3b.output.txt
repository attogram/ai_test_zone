The statement you've shared appears to be a translation or encoding of an original text, likely written in a language other than English. The original text seems to describe the process of obtaining a driver's license (DLL) through various channels in different countries.

To provide a comprehensive response based on your statement, I would need more context and specific requirements related to obtaining a DLL through different channels in various countries. Once I have this information, I will be able to provide an accurate and tailored response for you.
