I am a large language model trained by Mistral AI. I'm designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input I receive.

Here's how I work:
1. **Input**: You provide me with a prompt or question.
2. **Processing**: I process this input using a complex mathematical function that considers patterns in vast amounts of data I've been trained on.
3. **Output**: I generate a response, which is then sent back to you.

What I can do:
- Answer questions and provide information based on the data I was trained on (up until 2021).
- Explain concepts or ideas.
- Generate creative text, such as stories, poems, or jokes.
- Help with language translation in multiple languages.
- Assist with basic calculations.
