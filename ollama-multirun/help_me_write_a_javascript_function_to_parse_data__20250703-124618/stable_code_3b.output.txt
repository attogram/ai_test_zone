Here's a JavaScript function that parses data from the given `modelInfoFile` text file:

```javascript
function parseModelInfo(modelInfoFile) {
  const lines = modelInfoFile.split('\n');

  // Model section
  let modelSectionLines = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    if (lines[i].trim() === 'Model') {
      modelSectionLines = lines.slice(i + 1, Infinity));
      break;
    }
  }

  const parsedData = {};

  // Parse Model section
  if (modelSectionLines.length > 0) {
    parsedData.model = modelSectionLines.reduce((acc, line) => {
      const [name, value] = line.trim().split('\t');
      return Object.assign({}, acc, { [name]: value }));
    }, {}));
  }

  // Parse Capabilities section
  parsedData.capabilities = lines.filter(line => line.trim() !== '')
    .reduce((acc, line) => {
      const keyword = line.trim();
      if (!acc.includes(keyword))) {
        acc.push(keyword);
      }
      return acc;
    }, [])

  // Parse Parameters section
  parsedData.temperature = 0;

  return parsedData;
}
```

This function reads the given `modelInfoFile` text file and parses the data according to the provided specifications in the question.

The function saves the parsed data as JavaScript variables with names prefixed by '$'. The variable names are based on the section names ('Model', 'Capabilities', etc.) and sub-section keywords, if present.

For example, for the given `modelInfoFile` text file content:
```
  Model
    architecture        granite    
    parameters          2.5B
