Okay, I need to write a JavaScript function that parses data from model.info.txt based on the given rules. Let me break down each section and figure out how to handle them.

First, the Model section. Each line is in the format "name value", like "architecture granite". For each name, I should set it as a variable with the key equal to the value. So I'll loop through each line, extract the name and value, and assign them using $variable = value.

Next, the Capabilities section has single keywords. Each line is just a keyword without any spaces. These need to be collected into an array of strings in lowercase, probably, since some names might have uppercase letters depending on how they're formatted, but I should make sure it's case-insensitive or handle variations.

The System section includes multiple lines with system prompts. I think each line is a single prompt. So I'll loop through these lines and for each line that isn't empty, save the line as $systemPrompt.

The Parameters section has the same format as Model, but only temperature is saved. Each parameter line starts with "temperature", so I'll extract it by taking every other word starting from the third position (since the first two are "temperature" and maybe another keyword). Wait, looking at the example in parameters.txt: "num_ctx 16384" becomes temperature 0. So each line has multiple keywords separated by spaces, and only the last one is temperature. I'll split each parameter line into an array, take the second to last element as temperature.

The License section is more complex. It's on a single line with optional parts like version and date. The first part could be "Apache License", then version 2.0, etc. So I'll parse this by extracting the first part that starts with Apache or another keyword. I can split the string into components using space as a separator and take the first non-empty component for version information.

Putting it all together, I'll write a function that reads each line in order, determines which section it belongs to, processes accordingly, collects the variables, array, and strings, and returns them.

I need to handle missing sections or lines by skipping them. Also, ensure that names are correctly captured without any extra spaces. For system prompts, just assign them as is, but perhaps trim whitespace from each line in System section.

Testing with the example model.info.txt should help verify if all sections are processed correctly. I'll make sure that variables are named after the format like architecture, parameters, etc., and array elements have consistent case (lowercase).

Potential issues: Handling varying spaces or multiple spaces between fields. Maybe using trim and split to extract parts accurately.

So, the function will:

1. Read all lines from model.info.txt.
2. For each line:
   a. Skip empty lines.
   b. Check which section it's in based on an order (Model first, then Capabilities, System, Parameters).
3. Process according to section type:
   - Model: extract name and value, assign $var = value.
   - Capabilities: add keyword as string.
   - System: add line as $systemPrompt if not empty.
   - Parameters: extract temperature from each parameter line.

I'll structure the code step by step, handling each case carefully. Also, ensure that all variables are correctly named and strings are properly formatted.

Wait, in the example, the System section is a single paragraph with multiple lines. So I need to read each line within that paragraph as part of the system prompt. Each line represents an individual prompt, so I'll process each line individually for System, adding it to $systemPrompt if non-empty.

For Parameters, since it's in the same file, after processing Model and Capabilities, any remaining lines (those that aren't empty) are parameters and only temperature is saved as a number.

In terms of code structure:

- Read all lines.
- For each line, determine section type based on position.
- Depending on section, process name/value or keyword into variables.

Testing with the example should cover cases where sections have multiple entries. Also, handle cases where a parameter might be missing in Parameters section but present in System.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, let me code it step by step, making sure to capture all required parts.
