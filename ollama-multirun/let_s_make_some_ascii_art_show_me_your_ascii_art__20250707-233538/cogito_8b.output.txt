I'll create a simple ASCII art cat for you:

 /\_/\
( o.o )
 > ^ <

Here's another one - an owl:

 (\\__/)
 (='.'=)
  (")_(")

And finally, here's a happy little dog:

 /\_/\ 
( =w= )
 / \ /
`````

These are just simple examples. ASCII art can range from very basic to extremely complex! Would you like me to try creating something more elaborate?
