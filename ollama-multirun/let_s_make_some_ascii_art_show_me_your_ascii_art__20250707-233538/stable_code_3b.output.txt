Here's another example of ASCII art: a simple house:
```
 _____ _             ______        
|_   _| |           |    |          
  | | | |     .--./   \_,._ 
  |_| |_|    / \      ._\_
       |            /-  \_.-/
       |                     //  /
       |                    //---'
```
You can create more complex and detailed ASCII art by following the same pattern and adding additional characters to make the art look more realistic.
