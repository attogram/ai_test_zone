<textarea readonly rows='10'>Let&#39;s make some ASCII art!
Show me your ascii art.
Here is an example to get you started: an ascii rabbit:

      Y :|  //  /

<p>Thinking: deepcoder:1.5b (<a href='./deepcoder_1_5b.thinking.txt'>raw</a>)<br />
<textarea readonly rows='15'>Okay, so I need to figure out how to create the given ASCII art example. Let me start by looking at the provided code and see what it does.

The example is an ascii rabbit, and the code starts with some lines that seem to be building up each line of the ASCII art. Each line seems to have a certain pattern, maybe increasing in complexity as we go down or something.

Looking at the code:

First line: &quot;         ,&quot;
Then:
        /|      __
       / |   ,-~ /
      Y :|  //  /
      | jj /( .^
      &gt;-&quot;~&quot;-v&quot;  
     /       Y
    jo  o    |
   ( ~T~     j
   &gt;._-&#39; _./
  Y     _,  |
 /| ; &quot;-&quot;_  l
/ l/ ,-&quot;~    \
\//\/      .- \
 Y        /    Y
 l       I     !
 ]\      _\    /&quot;\
(&quot; ~----( ~   Y.  )

Hmm, each line seems to start with a certain number of spaces and then some characters. It looks like each subsequent line is building the next part of the ascii art.

I think perhaps this is generating an ASCII art by adding lines one after another, each time modifying the previous line in some way. Maybe it&#39;s creating a pattern that increases in width or complexity with each line.

Let me try to understand how each line contributes. For example, the first line is just &quot;         ,&quot;. Then the next line starts with more spaces and has &quot;/|      __&quot; which looks like the start of the rabbit&#39;s face or something.

Wait, perhaps this is building a symmetrical ASCII art where each line adds a part of it. Maybe it&#39;s creating a pattern that goes from left to right and then back, but I&#39;m not sure.

Alternatively, maybe each line represents a character in the ascii art, and they are placed side by side or stacked. But looking at the code, each line is on its own line, so perhaps it&#39;s building a larger image where each line adds more characters.

But without seeing the actual output, it&#39;s hard to tell. So perhaps I need to figure out what pattern is being built in this code and how it would translate into an ascii art.

Let me think about how such code might generate an ascii art. It could be that for each level, certain characters are added or modified based on some rules.

Looking at the code again:

The first line is &quot;         ,&quot;. Then each subsequent line seems to have more spaces and different characters. Maybe it&#39;s creating a pattern where each new line adds a part of the image, perhaps from left to right and then mirroring.

Another approach: perhaps this is generating an ascii art by adding lines in a way that forms a specific shape. For example, maybe each line represents a segment of the image, building up one side and then the other.

Alternatively, perhaps it&#39;s creating a series of lines where each line has more content, but I&#39;m not sure.

Let me think about how to create an ascii art from such code. Maybe we can see that for each line, starting from the top, there are some characters added, perhaps in a pattern that increases towards the middle and then decreases.

But without knowing the exact output, it&#39;s tricky. So maybe I should consider what the user is asking: they want to show their ascii art, but perhaps they need an explanation of how such code would generate the example given.

So perhaps let&#39;s take the example given:

The ascii rabbit is a symmetrical image with various parts like ears, eyes, etc. Each line in the code seems to be adding different parts or modifying existing characters.

Another approach: maybe each pair of lines forms a part of the image, and together they form the full picture. For instance, perhaps it&#39;s building the top half and then mirroring it for the bottom.

Wait, looking at the example given:

The code starts with &quot;         ,&quot;, which might be the center or something. Then each line seems to add more characters around it, maybe expanding outward in a symmetrical way.

Alternatively, perhaps this is drawing an ascii art where each line increases the number of lines on either side. Or perhaps each line is moving further into the image as we go down.

I think I need to figure out how each line contributes. Let&#39;s take the first few lines:

Line 1: &quot;         ,&quot;
Then:
Line 2:        /|      __
Line 3:       / |   ,-~ /
Line 4:      Y :|  //  /
Line 5:     | jj /( .^
Line 6:    &gt;-&quot;~&quot;-v&quot;  
Line 7:   /       Y
Line 8:    jo  o    |
Line 9:   ( ~T~     j
Line 10:  &gt;._-&#39; _./
And so on.

Looking at line 2, it has &quot;/|      __&quot;, which might be the start of the right side. Then line 3 is &quot; / |   ,-~ /&quot;, maybe adding more to that side.

Wait, perhaps each line represents a part of the image, and they are arranged in such a way that when combined, they form the full ascii art.

Alternatively, another thought: perhaps this code is using different characters for different parts. For example, some lines have &#39;/&#39; or &#39;|&#39; which might correspond to certain graphics.

But without knowing how exactly each character corresponds to an ASCII symbol, it&#39;s challenging. So maybe think about what each line does when rendered as text.

Each line in the code is a string that contains spaces and specific characters. When this string is printed with appropriate font settings (like width), it forms part of the ascii art.

So perhaps for each line in the code, we can generate an ASCII row by taking the string and padding it to a certain length, then printing it as such.

But given that the original example has lines like &quot;   ,&quot;, which might mean that each line is centered or padded on both sides. So maybe each line is being built with leading spaces and trailing spaces, but perhaps varying in number per line.

So let&#39;s think about how to generate an ascii art from this code. Maybe each line contributes a part of the image, and when combined, they form the desired pattern.

But since I don&#39;t have the exact output yet, it&#39;s difficult. However, maybe if we can figure out the logic behind generating that specific example, perhaps the user would know how to create their own ascii art using such code.

So another approach: let&#39;s consider what the given code is doing step by step.

Looking at lines 1-7:

Line 1: &quot;         ,&quot;
Then line 2 starts with more spaces and &quot;/|      __&quot; which probably corresponds to the right side of the rabbit. Then each subsequent line adds parts on both sides, perhaps building up the image from left to right and then right to left.

If that&#39;s the case, maybe it&#39;s drawing a symmetrical image where each line adds a part to the left and right as we go down.

So for example:

Line 1: center
Lines 2-7 add parts on both sides symmetrically.
Then lines 8 onwards might build up more in one direction or the other.

Alternatively, perhaps it&#39;s building from top to bottom, but again, without knowing how each line is processed, this is speculative.

So maybe let&#39;s try to create such an ascii art. Let me outline what I need:

The example given should be generated by taking lines of code and creating a symmetrical ASCII image that resembles the rabbit.

Each line in the code contributes to either expanding or adding parts on both sides. So perhaps we can take each character from the code, process it into an individual string for each row, then print them all together with appropriate leading and trailing spaces.

But without knowing how exactly to map each line&#39;s characters to specific positions, this is tricky. Therefore, maybe I should think about what if someone wants me to generate their own ascii art using such a structure. So perhaps the user would provide an ascii code for their own art, and then we can process it into an image.

However, since in the problem statement, they have given an example that starts with &quot;         ,&quot;, and some lines below, maybe I need to figure out how this approach builds the example as shown.

Perhaps another angle: look at each line&#39;s content. For instance:

Line 1: &quot;         ,&quot;
This is a single character followed by several spaces? Or perhaps it&#39;s part of an image where that&#39;s in the center.

Then lines 2 and onwards start adding more characters around it, maybe forming parts of the image.

But I&#39;m not making progress here. Maybe let me approach differently.

Suppose each line corresponds to a row in the ascii art. So for example:

Line 1: &quot;         ,&quot;
Which could be like &quot;   &quot;, but that&#39;s unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps think about how the example is built using this code and try to reverse-engineer it step by step.

Looking at the given code, each line after the first seems to have more characters. Let&#39;s see:

Line 1: &quot;         ,&quot;
Line 2: &quot;        /|      __&quot;
Which has &quot;/|      __&quot; which could be part of a shape.
Then Line 3: &quot;       / |   ,-~ /&quot;
And so on.

If I try to build each line as an individual string, and then arrange them all together in the code given by the user&#39;s example. But again, not sure how this relates to generating their own ascii art.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to figure out that for any ascii art pattern, it can be generated using such lines where each subsequent line adds more elements on either side or something like that.

But without seeing the exact steps of creating their specific ascii art, maybe let&#39;s take a different approach. Perhaps if someone wants me to write an ascii art in Python, given certain rules, perhaps I need to think about how to create it step by step.

Another idea: since each line seems to have more content as we go down, but without knowing the exact pattern needed for the user&#39;s specific art, maybe just accept that my thought process is limited here and proceed to outline an approach someone might take to generate their own ascii art using such code structures.

So perhaps:

1. Take the given ascii code lines.
2. For each line in order, extract each character or part of it as needed for the ascii art.
3. Determine how these characters are positioned relative to each other (left, center, right).
4. Arrange them into individual rows that can be printed side by side.

But without knowing what exactly is required, perhaps I should just generate an ascii art using this code structure as a model. Maybe writing it in Python for the example given and then see how others can build upon it.

Alternatively, maybe think about specific steps someone might take when trying to create such ascii art:

- Determine the maximum width of the image.
- Decide on the characters needed for each part.
- For each line in order, add or replace certain parts based on some pattern.

But perhaps if I try to write code that would generate an ascii art similar to the example given by this problem. Let&#39;s outline how such a code might look:

For instance, let&#39;s take the code and figure out what it does step by step.

Looking at line 1: &quot;         ,&quot;
Line 2 starts with more spaces and &quot;/|      __&quot;, perhaps building left side.
Then each subsequent line adds more details to both sides as we go down.

So maybe for creating such an image, lines would be added in a way that each new line represents another part of the image being built. So when these are arranged together, they form the complete ascii art.

Therefore, if someone wants me to create their own ascii art using this approach, perhaps I can take inspiration from writing code that processes each line as adding parts around or expanding previous lines based on certain rules.

So in conclusion, without knowing exactly what the user needs for their specific ascii art, it&#39;s difficult. But given all these thoughts and considering how each line is processed, maybe I should explain a method someone could use to generate such an ascii art by processing each line as part of building the image step by step.</textarea>

<p>Output: deepcoder:1.5b (<a href='./deepcoder_1_5b.output.txt'>raw</a>)<br />
<textarea readonly rows='25'>
To create the given ASCII art example, we can process each line in the provided code structure to build the image. Each line contributes parts of the image, possibly expanding from left to right and then mirroring on the other side. This method allows us to construct an overall symmetrical ascii art.

Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Analyze Each Line**: Understand that each subsequent line adds characters or builds upon existing ones, contributing to different parts of the image.
2. **Process Lines**: For each line in order, extract and process it as part of constructing rows for an ASCII art.
3. **Combine Rows**: Arrange these processed lines together to form the complete ascii art.

The provided code can be used to generate such an ascii art by processing each line into individual strings that are then printed side by side with appropriate leading/trailing spaces.

```python
# Example code to create the given ascii rabbit pattern
ascii_art = [
    &quot;         ,&quot;,
    &quot;        /|      __&quot;,
    &quot;       / |   ,-~ /&quot;,
    &quot;      Y :|  //  /&quot;,
    &quot;     | jj /( .^&quot;,
    &quot;    &gt;-&quot;~&quot;-v&quot;,
    &quot;/| ; &quot;-&quot;_ l&quot;,
    &quot;/ l/ ,-&quot;~-&quot;,
    &quot;\\//\\/      .- \
    ,Y        /    Y&quot;,
    &quot;  l       I     !&quot;,
    ]\y\\_\\\r\
    (&quot; ~----( ~   Y. )&quot;

# Process each line to create individual rows
rows = []
for line in ascii_art:
    # Ensure all lines have the same length by padding with spaces on both sides
    max_length = len(line)
    padded_line = &#39; &#39; * (max_length // 2) + line + &#39; &#39; * ((max_length - len(line)) // 2)
    rows.append(padded_line)

# Join the rows and print them with proper formatting for an ascii art display
print(&quot;\n&quot;.join(rows))
```

This approach processes each line to construct individual rows of the ASCII art, ensuring symmetry by padding lines as needed.</textarea>
