To create the given ASCII art example, we can process each line in the provided code structure to build the image. Each line contributes parts of the image, possibly expanding from left to right and then mirroring on the other side. This method allows us to construct an overall symmetrical ascii art.

Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Analyze Each Line**: Understand that each subsequent line adds characters or builds upon existing ones, contributing to different parts of the image.
2. **Process Lines**: For each line in order, extract and process it as part of constructing rows for an ASCII art.
3. **Combine Rows**: Arrange these processed lines together to form the complete ascii art.

The provided code can be used to generate such an ascii art by processing each line into individual strings that are then printed side by side with appropriate leading/trailing spaces.

```python
# Example code to create the given ascii rabbit pattern
ascii_art = [
    "         ,",
    "        /|      __",
    "       / |   ,-~ /",
    "      Y :|  //  /",
    "     | jj /( .^",
    "    >-"~"-v",
    "/| ; "-"_ l",
    "/ l/ ,-"~-",
    "\\//\\/      .- \
    ,Y        /    Y",
    "  l       I     !",
    ]\y\\_\\\r\
    (" ~----( ~   Y. )"

# Process each line to create individual rows
rows = []
for line in ascii_art:
    # Ensure all lines have the same length by padding with spaces on both sides
    max_length = len(line)
    padded_line = ' ' * (max_length // 2) + line + ' ' * ((max_length - len(line)) // 2)
    rows.append(padded_line)

# Join the rows and print them with proper formatting for an ascii art display
print("\n".join(rows))
```

This approach processes each line to construct individual rows of the ASCII art, ensuring symmetry by padding lines as needed.
