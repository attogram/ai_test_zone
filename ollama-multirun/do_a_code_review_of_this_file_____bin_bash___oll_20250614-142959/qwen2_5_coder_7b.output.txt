This script appears to be designed for running a series of text generation tasks using the Ollama model and generating reports on their performance. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the script does:

1. **Command Line Parsing**: The `parseCommandLine` function processes command-line arguments to determine which models to run, the prompt to use, and other settings.

2. **Model Setup**: 
   - `setModels` initializes the list of models that will be used.
   - `setPrompt` reads or generates a prompt for the text generation task.

3. **Output Directory Creation**: The script creates a directory structure to store results (`createOutputDirectory`).

4. **Main Index HTML**: An index page is created to provide an overview of all runs and models (`createMainIndexHtml`).

5. **Model-Specific Files**:
   - `savePrompt`: Saves the prompt to a file for record-keeping.
   - `createModelInfoTxt`: Generates a file with information about each model.

6. **Run Models**:
   - The script loops through each model, clears it (if necessary), runs it using Ollama, and captures output and statistics (`setStats`, `createModelOutputHtml`).

7. **Results Aggregation**:
   - Results are added to the main index page as they complete (`addModelToOutputIndexHtml`).
   - After all models have been run, the final index page is completed with system stats and other summary information (`finishOutputIndexHtml`).
   - A model index page is created to provide a hierarchical view of results by model (`createMainModelIndexHtml`).

8. **System Statistics**:
   - The script measures and records various statistics during and after each run, such as total duration, load time, prompt eval counts, etc.

9. **HTML Output**: The script generates HTML pages for each model run to provide detailed reports on the results.

### Usage

To use this script, you would typically call it from the command line with appropriate arguments. For example:

```sh
./run_ollama.sh --models model1 model2 model3 --prompt "Your prompt here"
```

This would initiate runs for `model1`, `model2`, and `model3` using the specified prompt.

### Dependencies

Ensure that Ollama is installed and accessible from your system. The script assumes that `ollama run` can be called directly from the command line.

### Notes

- The script uses some custom HTML templates (like `showHeader`, `showFooter`) which are not provided in this snippet but should be defined elsewhere in the script.
- Error handling is minimal; you might want to add more robust error checking depending on your use case.
- The script assumes that all models and their associated files are available and correctly configured.
