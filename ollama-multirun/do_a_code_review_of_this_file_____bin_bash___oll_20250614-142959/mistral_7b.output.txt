 This script appears to be a shell script for generating HTML pages showcasing the results of running an AI model (specifically, Ollama) on some provided input. The script takes command line arguments and sets various variables based on them, then it creates directories and files for storing the output of each run.

The main functionality of the script can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Parse the command line arguments to set variables such as the name of the AI model, the prompt to use when running the model, and the directory where the results will be stored.
2. Set various system-related variables, such as the current system's memory usage and the maximum number of models that can be loaded simultaneously by Ollama.
3. Create directories for storing the output files and HTML pages.
4. Generate an overview page (`models.html`) listing all the AI models that were run and providing links to each individual model run.
5. For each model, clear its state, run it with the specified prompt, save its output and statistics to separate files, set various system- and model-related variables based on the output, create an HTML page showcasing the results of running the model, and add a link to that page from the overview page.
6. Finally, generate another HTML page summarizing the overall results (`index.html`) and provide links to each individual model run as well as to the models overview page.

Overall, this script provides a convenient way to run an AI model on some input, save its output and statistics, and display the results in a user-friendly HTML format.
