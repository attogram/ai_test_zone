I need to determine how many times the letter 'r' appears in the word "Strawberry".

First, I'll write down the word: S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y.

Next, I'll go through each letter one by one and count the 'r's.

Starting from the beginning:
- The first letter is S.
- The second letter is T.
- The third letter is R â€“ that's one 'r'.
- Continuing on, I find another R later in the word.

After examining all the letters, there are two 'r's in total.
