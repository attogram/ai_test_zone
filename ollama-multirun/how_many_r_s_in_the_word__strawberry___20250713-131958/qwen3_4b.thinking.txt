Okay, let's see. The user is asking how many 'r's are in the word "Strawberry". Hmm, first I need to make sure I have the correct spelling of the word. Let me spell it out: S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. Strawberry. S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Yeah, that's correct. So the letters are S, T, R, A, W, B, E, R, R, Y. Now, I need to count the number of times the letter 'r' appears in that sequence.

Let me go through each letter one by one. The first letter is S, not R. Then T, not R. Next is R, that's one. Then A, not R. Then W, not R. Then B, not R. Then E, not R. Then the next letter is R, that's two. Then another R, that's three. And then Y. So in total, there are three R's. Wait, let me confirm again. S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. So positions 3, 8, and 9 are R. So three times. I think that's right. But maybe I should write it out to be sure. S T R A W B E R R Y. Yes, that's three R's. So the answer should be 3.
