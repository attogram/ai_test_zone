To find how many times the letter 'r' appears in the word "Strawberry," I will begin by writing down the entire phrase.

Next, I'll identify each individual letter. The first letter is 'S,' followed by 't,' then 'r.' This marks one occurrence of 'r.'

Continuing through the word: after 'r,' there's an 'a' and a 'w.' So far, only one 'r.' 

The next letters are 'f,' 'u,' and another 'r.' That adds a second 'r.' Now I have two instances.

Finally, the remaining letters in "Strawberry" do not include any additional 'r's. This means that the total number of 'r's in the word is two.
