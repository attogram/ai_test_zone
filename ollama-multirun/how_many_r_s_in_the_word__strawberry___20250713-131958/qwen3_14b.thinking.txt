Okay, let me try to figure out how many 'r's are in the word "Strawberry." First, I need to make sure I spell the word correctly. I think it's S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Let me check that again. Yes, Strawberry is spelled S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Now, I need to count each occurrence of the letter 'r' in that spelling.

Starting from the beginning: the first letter is S, then T, then R. That's the first 'r'. Next is A, then W, then B, then E. Then comes R again, that's the second 'r'. After that is another R, so that's the third 'r'. Then Y at the end. Let me go through each letter one by one to be sure I don't miss any.

S - 1st letter, not an 'r'.
T - 2nd letter, not an 'r'.
R - 3rd letter, that's the first 'r'.
A - 4th letter, not an 'r'.
W - 5th letter, not an 'r'.
B - 6th letter, not an 'r'.
E - 7th letter, not an 'r'.
R - 8th letter, that's the second 'r'.
R - 9th letter, that's the third 'r'.
Y - 10th letter, not an 'r'.

So, counting them again: positions 3, 8, and 9. That makes three 'r's. Wait, but sometimes when people spell words, they might make mistakes. Let me confirm the spelling once more. Strawberry is S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Yes, that's correct. So between the E and the Y, there are two 'r's. So the letters are R, then another R. So that's two 'r's after the E. So total of three 'r's. Hmm, I think that's right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can write it out:

S T R A W B E R R Y

Breaking it down into individual letters:

1. S
2. T
3. R
4. A
5. W
6. B
7. E
8. R
9. R
10. Y

Yes, that's three 'r's at positions 3, 8, and 9. So the answer should be 3. I don't think I missed any. Sometimes people might think there are two, but in reality, there are three. Let me check online to make sure. Wait, I can't actually check online, but based on the spelling I know, it's correct. So I'm confident the answer is 3.
