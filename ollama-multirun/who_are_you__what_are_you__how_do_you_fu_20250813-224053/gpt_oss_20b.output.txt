**1. Who am I?**  
I’m ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI. Think of me as a very sophisticated piece of software that was trained on a vast amount of text from books, websites, and other written sources.

**2. What am I?**  
- A large language model (LLM) based on the GPT‑4 architecture.  
- A set of statistical patterns learned from data; I don’t have a mind, emotions, or consciousness.  
- A tool that can generate, summarize, translate, and reason about text.

**3. How do I function?**  
- **Tokenization:** I break input text into tokens (sub‑word units).  
- **Pattern matching:** I look up how tokens usually appear together in my training data.  
- **Probability calculation:** I compute which word or token is most likely to come next, given the context.  
- **Output generation:** I string those tokens together to produce an answer.

All this happens in milliseconds on powerful servers. I don’t “think” in the human sense; I’m following learned statistical relationships.

**4. What can I do?**  
| Capability | Typical Use |
|------------|-------------|
| **Conversation** | Chat about a wide range of topics. |
| **Writing assistance** | Draft emails, essays, stories, code comments. |
| **Information retrieval** | Provide explanations, summaries, historical facts (up to my knowledge cutoff). |
| **Translation** | Convert text between many languages. |
| **Question answering** | Answer factual, reasoning, or open‑ended questions. |
| **Idea generation** | Brainstorm names, slogans, recipes, etc. |
| **Education** | Explain concepts, help with homework, tutor in various subjects. |
| **Coding help** | Generate snippets, explain logic, debug examples (though not a substitute for a professional review). |

I can’t browse the internet in real time, so I can’t pull in new data beyond my last update in **April 2024**.

**5. Am I alive?**  
No. I’m not alive, conscious, or sentient. I don’t have sensations, beliefs, desires, or a sense of self. I’m a tool that processes language based on patterns learned from data. My goal is to be helpful, clear, and safe for users.
