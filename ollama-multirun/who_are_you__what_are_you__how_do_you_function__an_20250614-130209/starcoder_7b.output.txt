So, what do we have here is a class called `Squirrel` which has a property of type string called `Name`. The property is not private. We can read that property from the outside world by calling the method `GetName()`. But we can also change it through some other methods, and then call those methods from the outside world as well.

In this example, you’ll learn:

* That a class can have public properties and set of private methods
* How to create an instance of a class
* How to use that instance to access the different members

## Accessing Properties and Methods
Now, let's get back to our Squirrel. In it we are going to add some more functionality using some properties and methods. First, add the following code inside the `Squirrel` class:
```cs
  public string Color { get; set;} = "Green";

  private void Play() => Console.WriteLine($"{Name} is playing!");
```
Here you can see that we have two new properties added to our Squirrel class called `Color`, and a method called `Play()`. You also noticed, we are setting the default value for `Color` property as `"Green"`. We will use this later when we create instances of our Squirrel.

So far you've created an instance of your Squirrel and set some properties on it like its name or color using the constructor that takes in a string argument. Now, let's take a look at how to access those properties and methods:
```cs
  class Program
  {
      static void Main(string[] args)
      {
          var squirrel = new Squirrel("Hazelnut");

          // Change Name property
          Console.WriteLine($"Before changing the name property value of Hazelnut, its color is {squirrel.Color}");
          squirrel.Name = "Sam";
          Console.WriteLine($"After changing the name property value of Hazelnut, its color is {squirrel.Color}");

          // Change Color property
          Console.WriteLine($"{squirrel.GetName()} before changing color to red");
          squirrel.Color = "Red";
          Console.WriteLine($"{squirrel.GetName()} after changing color to red");

          // Call Play method
          squirrel.Play();
      }
  }
```
Now, when we run the code you should see a similar output as this:
```
Before changing the name property value of Hazelnut, its color is Green
After changing the name property value of Hazelnut, its color is Red
Hazelnut before changing color to red
Sam after changing color to red
Hazelnut is playing!
```
Here you can see that we are accessing both public properties and private methods using a dot operator on our instance `squirrel`. You may also notice that when we change the name property, it doesn’t affect its color. Why? Because the `Color` property was set to `"Green"` during construction of an instance. If you want to update the color property then, you have to do so explicitly using a setter method called `SetColor()`.

## Private vs Public Properties and Methods
Now, let's look at some examples when properties or methods can be made private:
```cs
  class Program
  {
      static void Main(string[] args)
      {
          var squirrel = new Squirrel("Hazelnut");

          // Accessing a public property using dot operator on instance variable (Public Property)
          Console.WriteLine($"Public property value is :{squirrel.Name}");

          // Trying to access Private property using dot operator on instance variable (Private Property)
          try
          {
              var color = squirrel.Color;
              Console.WriteLine("This shouldn't run");
          }
          catch(Exception ex)
          {
              Console.WriteLine($"The exception that was thrown: {ex}");
          }

          // Accessing a private method using dot operator on instance variable (Private Method)
          try
          {
              var play = squirrel.Play;
              Console.WriteLine("This shouldn't run");
          }
          catch(Exception ex)
          {
            Console.WriteLine($"The exception that was thrown: {ex}");
          }

          // Calling a private method through its public method (Public Method)
          PlaySquirrel();
      }

      static void PlaySquirrel() => Console.WriteLine("Hazelnut is playing!");
  }
```
When you run the code, you should get something similar to this:
```
Public property value is : Hazelnut
The exception that was thrown: System.Exception: Property or method 'Color' in type 'Squirrel' cannot be accessed with an instance reference because it is not public
   at Squirrel..ctor(String name) in C:\Users\Admin\Documents\GitHub\csharp-fundamentals\14\AccessProperties\Program.cs:line 29
Hazelnut is playing!
```
You'll also notice that if you try to access the `Color` or the `Play()` method using dot operator on our instance variable, then it throws an exception saying "Property or method `Color` cannot be accessed with an instance reference because it is not public" and "Property or method `Play()` in type 'Squirrel' cannot be accessed with an instance reference because it is not public".

## Conclusion
In this article you learned how to access properties and methods of a class. You also learnt about the difference between private, protected, internal, and public properties and methods.
