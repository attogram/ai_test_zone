Okay, let's see. The user is asking how many times the letter 'r' appears in the word "Strawberry." Alright, first I need to make sure I spell the word correctly. Let me write it out: S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Hmm, yes, that's correct. Now, I need to count the number of 'r's.

Starting from the beginning: the first letter is S, then T, then R. So that's one 'r'. Next letters are A, W, B, E. Then comes R again. That's the second 'r'. Then another R, so that's the third 'r'. And then Y at the end. So in total, there are three 'r's. Wait, let me go through each letter one by one to make sure I don't miss any.

Breaking down "Strawberry" letter by letter:

1. S
2. T
3. R
4. A
5. W
6. B
7. E
8. R
9. R
10. Y

So positions 3, 8, and 9 are 'r's. That makes three 'r's. Let me confirm once more. The word is spelled S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Yes, the third letter is R, then after E, there are two R's in a row. So that's three in total. I think that's correct. Maybe I should write it out again to visualize:

S T R A W B E R R Y

Counting the R's: first R at position 3, then two more R's at positions 8 and 9. Yep, three R's. I don't think I made a mistake here. So the answer should be 3.
