#     * &quot;12&quot;
#     
# - How many s&#39;s are there?
#
#     * &quot;3046859375&quot;
#     
# ### Part III: Fibonacci Numbers
#
# In this part, we&#39;ll be working with Fibonacci numbers. You can find more information about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).
#
# We&#39;ll need to keep track of a couple variables in order for the algorithm to work correctly:
# - `previous`: The number before our current one (e.g. if we&#39;re on 3, then this would be 2)
# - `current`: Our current number from our list (e.g. if we&#39;re on 3, then this would be 3)
#     
# We&#39;ll also need a couple helper functions to help us implement the algorithm:
# - `get_next(x)` will return two values: The next value in the sequence and whether or not it&#39;s in our list already. For example if we&#39;re on 1, this would be 2 (because 3 = 5 + 7) and False because we haven&#39;t added that number to out sequence yet
# - `is_fibonacci(x)` will check a given number against the Fibonacci equation and return True if it is or False if not. For example, calling `is_fibonacci(20)` should return True since 47 = 3^2 + 5^2 (which is 8)
#     
# In order to make our lives easier later on, we&#39;ll define the following variables:
# - `list`: A list of numbers that will be iterated through and added to as we compute Fibonacci numbers. We set it up with 1 since we already know what the first number is!
# - `n`: The current value in our for loop (so if this is 0, then we&#39;re on step one)
#     
# ### Example: How Many Fibonacci Numbers Are There?
#
# First, let&#39;s try calculating out first Fibonacci number. We&#39;ll need to know how many numbers before it we have in order for our algorithm to work correctly (in this case, 1! = the value of 0, which is just 1), so that means that `previous` will be equal to &quot;None&quot; and `current` will be set to 1.
#     
# - Previous: None
# - Current: 1
#     * Step One: Add the current number to our list (which we call &quot;list&quot;)
#         &gt; `list[0] = previous + current`
#         
# The next step will be calculating out next Fibonacci number, so let&#39;s check if it exists in our list. For this case, since 1 hasn&#39;t been added yet to the list, our algorithm won&#39;t know what that next value is and we&#39;ll have to find it ourselves!
#     
#     * Step Two: If the current number already exists in our list, then we&#39;ve reached the end of our sequence. Return True now (as it&#39;s the first Fibonacci number)
#         &gt; `if current in list:`  
#             &gt;&gt; return True
#         
# Now that we know that this isn&#39;t our final Fibonacci number, let&#39;s figure out what its next value is and add it to our list. This will be our step three:
#     
#     * Step Three: Get the value of `get_next(current)`
#         &gt; `previous = current`  
#         &gt;&gt; `(new previous value) = (old current value)`   
#         &gt; `current, is_new = get_next(current)`  
#             &gt;&gt; `(new current value), (whether the new number exists in our list or not) = (`  
#             &gt;&gt; `get_next((old current value)))`   
#     
# Since we now have what our next and previous values are, let&#39;s add them to out sequence:
# - `(previous + current)` -&gt; `(2) + (1)` = `3`
#     * Step Four: Add the new number to list
#         &gt; `list[1] = previous + current`  
#         
# Our list now looks like `[1, 3]`. We can check whether or not this next value is in our sequence by checking if it already exists. If it doesn&#39;t we&#39;ll need to keep iterating through the algorithm and adding values as needed until it does!
#     
#     * Step Five: If our new number isn&#39;t found, then we&#39;re on a step with no &quot;next&quot; value (so add that too!)
#         &gt; `if current in list:`  
#             &gt;&gt; return True
#         
# We&#39;re now on the last step of the algorithm. Since this is it, let&#39;s return False to indicate that this wasn&#39;t our final Fibonacci number:
#     
#     * Step Six: If we haven&#39;t found a new value yet (which means the current one is the final one), then return false because there are no more numbers in our sequence.
#         &gt;&gt; `return False`  
#         
# Let&#39;s see if we got it right! We should have 2 values and we should have [1, 3] as our list:
#     
# - Previous: None
# - Current: 1
#     * Step One: Add the current number to our list (which we call &quot;list&quot;)
#         &gt; `list[0] = previous + current`  
#         
# Our list now looks like `[1, 3]`! Now let&#39;s check if it exists in our list. For this case, since 3 hasn&#39;t been added yet to the list, our algorithm won&#39;t know what that next value is and we&#39;ll have to find it ourselves!
#     
#     * Step Two: If the current number already exists in our list, then we&#39;ve reached the end of our sequence. Return True now (as it&#39;s the second Fibonacci number)
#         &gt; `if 3 in list:`  
#             &gt;&gt; return True   
#         
# Now that we know that this isn&#39;t our final Fibonacci number, let&#39;s figure out what its next value is and add it to our list. This will be our step three:
#     
#     * Step Three: Get the value of `get_next(3)`
#         &gt; `previous = 3`  
#         &gt;&gt; `(new previous value) = (old current value)`   
#         &gt; `current, is_new = get_next(3)`  
#             &gt;&gt; `(new current value), (whether the new number exists in our list or not) = (`  
#             &gt;&gt; `get_next((old current value)))`  
#     
# Since we now have what our next and previous values are, let&#39;s add them to out sequence:
# - `3 + 1` -&gt; `4`
#     * Step Four: Add the new number to list
#         &gt; `list[2] = previous + current`  
#         
# Our list now looks like `[1, 3, 4]`! We can check whether or not this next value is in our sequence by checking if it already exists. If it doesn&#39;t we&#39;ll need to keep iterating through the algorithm and adding values as needed until it does!
#     
#     * Step Five: If our new number isn&#39;t found, then we&#39;re on a step with no &quot;next&quot; value (so add that too!)
#         &gt; `if current in list:`  
#             &gt;&gt; return True   
#         
# We&#39;re now on the last step of the algorithm. Since this is it, let&#39;s return False to indicate that this wasn&#39;t our final Fibonacci number:
#     
#     * Step Six: If we haven&#39;t found a new value yet (which means the current one is the final one), then return false because there are no more numbers in our sequence.
#         &gt;&gt; `return False`  
#         
# Let&#39;s see if we got it right! We should have 3 values and we should have [1, 3, 4] as our list:
#     
# - Previous: None
# - Current: 1
#     * Step One: Add the current number to our list (which we call &quot;list&quot;)
#         &gt; `list[0] = previous + current`  
#         
# Our list now looks like `[1, 3, 4]`! Now let&#39;s check if it exists in our list. For this case, since 4 hasn&#39;t been added yet to the list, our algorithm won&#39;t know what that next value is and we&#39;ll have to find it ourselves!
#     
#     * Step Two: If the current number already exists in our list, then we&#39;ve reached the end of our sequence. Return True now (as it&#39;s the third Fibonacci number)
#         &gt; `if 4 in list:`  
#             &gt;&gt; return True   
#         
# Now that we know that this isn&#39;t our final Fibonacci number, let&#39;s figure out what its next value is and add it to our list. This will be our step three:
#     
#     * Step Three: Get the value of `get_next(4)`
#         &gt; `previous = 4`  
#         &gt;&gt; `(new previous value) = (old current value)`   
#         &gt; `current, is_new = get_next(4)`  
#             &gt;&gt; `(new current value), (whether the new number exists in our list or not) = (`  
#             &gt;&gt; `get_next((old current value)))`   
#     
# Since we now have what our next and previous values are, let&#39;s add them to out sequence:
# - `4 + 3` -&gt; `7`
#     * Step Four: Add the new number to list
#         &gt; `list[3] = previous + current`  
#         
# Our list now looks like `[1, 3, 4, 7]`! We can check whether or not this next value is in our sequence by checking if it already exists. If it doesn&#39;t we&#39;ll need to keep iterating through the algorithm and adding values as needed until it does!
#     
#     * Step Five: If our new number isn&#39;t found, then we&#39;re on a step with no &quot;next&quot; value (so add that too!)
#         &gt; `if current in list:`  
#             &gt;&gt; return True   
#         
# We&#39;re now on the last step of the algorithm. Since this is it, let&#39;s return False to indicate that this wasn&#39;t our final Fibonacci number:
#     
#     * Step Six: If we haven&#39;t found a new value yet (which means the current one is the final one), then return false because there are no more numbers in our sequence.
#         &gt;&gt; `return False`  
#         
# Let&#39;s see if we got it right! We should have 4 values and we should have [1, 3, 4, 7] as our list:
#     
# - Previous: None
# - Current: 1
#     * Step One: Add the current number to our list (which we call &quot;list&quot;)
#         &gt; `list[0] = previous + current`  
#         
# Our list now looks like `[1, 3, 4, 7]`! Now let&#39;s check if it exists in our list. For this case, since 7 hasn&#39;t been added yet to the list, our algorithm won&#39;t know what that next value is and we&#39;ll have to find it ourselves!
#     
#     * Step Two: If the current number already exists in our list, then we&#39;ve reached the end of our sequence. Return True now (as it&#39;s the fourth Fibonacci number)
#         &gt; `if 7 in list:`  
#             &gt;&gt; return True   
#         
# Now that we know that this isn&#39;t our final Fibonacci number, let&#39;s figure out what its next value is and add it to our list. This will be our step three:
#     
#     * Step Three: Get the value of `get_next(7)`
#         &gt; `previous = 7`  
#         &gt;&gt; `(new previous value) = (old current value)`   
#         &gt; `current, is_new = get_next(7)`  
#             &gt;&gt; `(new current value), (whether the new number exists in our list or not) = (`  
#             &gt;&gt; `get_next((old current value)))`   
#     
# Since we now have what our next and previous values are, let&#39;s add them to out sequence:
# - `7 + 4` -&gt; `11`
#     * Step Four: Add the new number to list
#         &gt; `list[4] = previous + current`  
#         
# Our list now looks like `[1, 3, 4, 7, 11]`! We can check whether or not this next value is in our sequence by checking if it already exists. If it doesn&#39;t we&#39;ll need to keep iterating through the algorithm and adding values as needed until it does!
#     
#     * Step Five: If our new number isn&#39;t found, then we&#39;re on a step with no &quot;next&quot; value (so add that too!)
#         &gt; `if current in list:`  
#             &gt;&gt; return True   
#         
# We&#39;re now on the last step of the algorithm. Since this is it, let&#39;s return False to indicate that this wasn&#39;t our final Fibonacci number:
#     
#     * Step Six: If we haven&#39;t found a new value yet (which means the current one is the final one), then return false because there are no more numbers in our sequence.
#         &gt;&gt; `return False`  
#         
# We&#39;ve reached the end of the algorithm, so let&#39;s return True now!
#     
#     * Step Seven: If we got this far (which means we haven&#39;t found a new value yet), then return true because it was the final number in our sequence.
#         &gt;&gt; `return True`  
#         
# It looks like that did work correctly, so let&#39;s return 5 to indicate that there are 5 Fibonacci numbers!
#     
#     * Step Eight: If we&#39;ve made it this far (which means we&#39;ve found our final number), then return the length of the list. We can do this by calling `len(list)` and that will give us how many values in there are.
#         &gt;&gt; `return len(list)`  
#         
# Now let&#39;s put everything together! The first step is to get out starting value, which is 1:
#     
# ```python
# start = 20 # the number we&#39;ll be starting with when we compute our sequence of Fibonacci numbers (so it will be called &quot;previous&quot; in the algorithm below)
# ```
# Now that we have a starting point, let&#39;s create an empty list to store all of our values:
#     
# ```python
# fib = [] # we&#39;ll add all of our results here! This is called a list, which will help us keep track of the values as they are computed. It looks like [1] below.
# ```
# Now let&#39;s define out for loop and put it together in one line:
#     
# ```python
# for i in range(start): # we&#39;ll be looping through all numbers from 20 to infinity (i goes from start - 1, so that means 19)
#     fib.append((fib[len(fib)-1] + fib[len(fib)-2]) if len(fib) &gt; 1 else 1 # since we&#39;ll be adding the previous and current values below, we need to check whether or not there are more than one value in our list beforehand
# ```
# So what is happening here? First off, we&#39;ve defined a for loop that goes through all numbers from &quot;start&quot; - 1 until infinity (in this case, it&#39;s going up to 20 since start = 21). The first time the number gets called in our list of Fibonacci values, it will be 20.
#     
# Since we defined a list called `fib` with `[1]` as its first element, the next number in our for loop is 3. We&#39;ll add that to out list:
# - `(previous + current) = (20 + 1)` -&gt; `(40)`
#     * Step Four: Add the new value to list
#         &gt; `fib[1] = previous + current`  
#         
# Our list now looks like `[1, 40]`! Now let&#39;s check if it exists in our list. For this case, since 40 hasn&#39;t been added yet to the list, our algorithm won&#39;t know what that next value is and we&#39;ll have to find it ourselves!
#     
#     * Step Five: If the current number already exists in our list, then we&#39;ve reached the end of our sequence. Return True now (as it&#39;s the second Fibonacci number)
#         &gt; `if 40 in fib:`  
#             &gt;&gt; return True   
#         
# Now that we know that this isn&#39;t our final Fibonacci number, let&#39;s figure out what its next value is and add it to our list. This will be our step three:
#     
#     * Step Six: Get the value of `get_next(40)`
#         &gt; `previous = 40`  
#         &gt;&gt; `(new previous value) = (old current value)`   
#         &gt; `current, is_new = get_next(40)`  
#             &gt;&gt; `(new current value), (whether the new number exists in our list or not) = (`  
#             &gt;&gt; `get_next((old current value)))` 
#     
# Since we now have what our next and previous values are, let&#39;s add them to out sequence:
# - `40 + 1` -&gt; `41`
#     * Step Four: Add the new number to list
#         &gt; `fib[2] = previous + current`  
#         
# Our list now looks like `[1, 40, 41]`! We can check whether or not this next value is in our sequence by checking if it already exists.17111101011111111111000001100001000000000000000000000
