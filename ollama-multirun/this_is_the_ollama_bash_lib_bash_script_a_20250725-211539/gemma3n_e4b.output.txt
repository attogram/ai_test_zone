## Code Review of Ollama Bash Lib

This is a well-structured and comprehensive Bash library for interacting with the Ollama API. The script demonstrates good design principles with clear function separation, consistent error handling, and thoughtful use of variables. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of error handling, robustness, and adherence to Bash best practices.

**Overall Assessment:** The script is well-organized and functional. It provides a useful abstraction layer for interacting with Ollama, making it easier for developers to integrate Ollama into their Bash scripts. The use of functions with clear documentation is commendable.

**Detailed Review:**

**1. Shebang and Header:**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Ollama Bash Lib - A Bash Library to interact with Ollama
#
```
- Correct shebang using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for portability.
- Clear and concise header comments explaining the library's purpose.

**2. Configuration Variables:**

```bash
OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_NAME="Olllama Bash Lib"
OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_VERSION="0.16"
OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_URL="https://github.com/attogram/ollama-bash-lib"
OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_LICENSE="MIT"
OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_COPYRIGHT="Copyright (c) 2025 Attogram Project <https://github.com/attogram>"
OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_DEBUG=0
OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_API=${OLLAMA_HOST:-"http://localhost:11434"} # no slash at end
RETURN_SUCCESS=0
RETURN_ERROR=1
```
- Good practice to define version, URL, license, and copyright information.
- `OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_API` is a good way to define the API base URL with a default value. The comment about the missing slash is helpful.
- `RETURN_SUCCESS` and `RETURN_ERROR` are useful for consistent error handling.

**3. Debug Function:**

```bash
debug() {
 	if [ "$OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_DEBUG" == "1" ]; then
    	>&2 echo -e "[DEBUG] $1"
 	fi
}
```
- A simple and effective debug function. Using `>&2` to output to stderr is standard practice.

**4. `ollamaIsInstalled` Function:**

```bash
ollamaIsInstalled() {
 	debug "ollamaIsInstalled"
 	if [ -z "$(command -v "ollama" 2> /dev/null)" ]; then
   		 return $RETURN_ERROR
 	fi
 	return $RETURN_SUCCESS
}
```
- Correctly checks if the `ollama` command is available in the system's PATH.
- The `debug` message is helpful for understanding the function's execution.
- Using `return` is a typo, it should be `return`.

**5. `safeJson` Function:**

```bash
safeJson() {
 	debug "safeJson: $1"
 	jq -Rn --arg str "$1" '$str'
 	 # TODO - check response for error/success
 	 return $RETURN_SUCCESS
}
```
- Uses `jq` for safe JSON quoting, which is a good approach to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
- The comment `TODO - check response for error/success` is important as `jq` might return an error if the input is not valid JSON.

**6. API Interaction Functions (`ollamaApiGet`, `ollamaApiPost`):**

```bash
ollamaApiGet() {
 	debug "ollamaApiGet: $1"
 	curl -s -X GET "${OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_API}$1" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d ''
 	 # TODO - check response for error/success
 	 return $RETURN_SUCCESS
}

ollamaApiPost() {
 	debug "ollamaApiPost: $1 $2"
 	curl -s -X POST "${OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_API}$1" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "$2"
 	 # TODO - check response for error/success
 	 return $RETURN_SUCCESS
}
```
- Uses `curl` for making HTTP requests.
- Includes `Content-Type: application/json` header, which is correct for interacting with the Ollama API.
- The `-d` option is used correctly to send data in the request body.
- The comment `TODO - check response for error/success` is crucial. The script should parse the response from the Ollama API to handle errors and success cases.

**7. Model Management Functions (`ollamaClearModel`, `ollamaGenerate`, `ollamaGenerateStreaming`):**

- These functions demonstrate how to interact with specific Ollama API endpoints.
- The `ollamaClearModel` function correctly uses a POST request to the `/api/generate` endpoint with `keep_alive: 0`.
- The `ollamaGenerate` and `ollamaGenerateStreaming` functions correctly use the `/api/generate` endpoint with the appropriate parameters.
- The comments `TODO - check response for error/success` are present, highlighting the need for error handling.

**8. Model Listing Functions (`ollamaList`, `ollamaListJson`, `ollamaListArrray`):**

- These functions provide different ways to retrieve the list of available models.
- `ollamaListArrray` uses `awk` and `sort` to get a sorted list of model names, which is a good approach.
- `ollamaListJson` correctly uses the `/api/tags` endpoint to get the list of models in JSON format.
- `ollamaPs` and `ollamaPsJson` demonstrate how to get information about running models in both CLI and JSON formats.
- `ollamashow` and `ollamashowJson` demonstrate how to get information about a specific model in both CLI and JSON formats.
- `ollamaVersion` and `ollamaVersionJson` demonstrate how to get the Ollama application version in both CLI and JSON formats.

**9. Error Handling:**

- The script uses `return $RETURN_ERROR` to indicate errors.
- However, the error handling is currently basic. It doesn't parse the responses from the Ollama API to provide more informative error messages or handle different HTTP status codes.

**10. Code Style and Readability:**

- The code is generally well-formatted and easy to read.
- Consistent use of indentation and comments improves readability.
- Function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., `ollamaApiGet`).

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

- **Implement Robust Error Handling:** Parse the responses from the Ollama API (both JSON and potentially text) to handle errors gracefully. Check for non-success HTTP status codes and provide more informative error messages.
- **Consider Using `set -e`:** Adding `set -e` at the beginning of the script would cause the script to exit immediately if any command fails, which can be helpful for detecting errors.
- **Add Input Validation:** For functions that take arguments (e.g., `ollamaClearModel`, `ollamaGenerate`), consider adding input validation to ensure the arguments are valid.
- **Use More Idiomatic Bash:** While the script is functional, some parts could be written more idiomatically. For example, using arrays directly for iteration or using more concise syntax where appropriate.
- **Document API Response Handling:** Add comments to the functions indicating how to handle different API response scenarios (e.g., success, error).
- **Consider a More Structured Error Reporting Mechanism:** Instead of just returning an error code, consider using a more structured way to report errors, such as setting an error variable that can be accessed by the calling script.

**Conclusion:**

This Ollama Bash Lib is a valuable tool for automating interactions with the Ollama API. By addressing the recommended improvements, the script can become even more robust, user-friendly, and maintainable. The clear function structure and documentation make it a good starting point for developers who want to integrate Ollama into their Bash workflows.
