### Code Review of `ollama_bash_lib.sh`

The script appears to be well-structured and provides a comprehensive set of functions for interacting with the Ollama API. Below is a detailed review covering various aspects including code quality, security, best practices, and potential improvements.

#### General Comments
- **Documentation**: The script has good documentation within the comments. Each function has a brief description, usage, input parameters, output, and return values.
- **Variables and Constants**: Clear use of constants for return values and configuration options such as `OLLAMA_LIB_API`, `OLLAMA_DEBUG`, etc.

#### Code Quality
1. **Code Readability**:
   - The script uses consistent formatting (e.g., 2 spaces indentation).
   - Functions are well-named, making it clear what each function does.
   - Comments are helpful but sometimes redundant with the usage descriptions provided in the comments above the functions.

2. **Functions and Logic**:
   - Most functions follow a similar structure which makes them easy to read and understand.
   - The script avoids long functions by breaking down complex tasks into smaller functions.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Error handling is well-implemented with usage of `error` function for logging errors.
   - Functions return appropriate exit statuses (`$RETURN_SUCCESS`, `$RETURN_ERROR`).

#### Security and Best Practices
1. **Environment Variables**:
   - The script uses environment variables to configure the API URL, debug flag, etc., which is good practice.

2. **Sanitization**:
   - The `json_sanitize` function performs basic sanitization on input strings for JSON handling.
   - Consider using a more robust library or tool for JSON sanitization.

3. **Debugging and Logging**:
   - The use of the `debug` function helps in tracking script execution, especially useful during development.
   - Ensure debug logs do not expose sensitive information.

4. **Dependency Management**:
   - The script relies on external tools like `curl`, `jq`, etc., which are assumed to be available on the system.

#### Potential Improvements
1. **Error Messages and Codes**:
   - Enhance error messages with more context, especially when functions fail for unknown reasons.
   - Consider using a logging library or framework instead of custom error handling functions.

2. **Function Documentation**:
   - Use a tool like `help.sh` to generate help messages dynamically based on the function definitions if you want to provide interactive help.

3. **Code Duplication**:
   - The script contains multiple functions that perform similar tasks (e.g., JSON and text versions of chat completions). Consider refactoring these into a more generic structure.

4. **Testing**:
   - Ensure thorough testing with unit tests for each function, especially for complex ones like `ollama_chat_json` and `ollama_generate_stream`.

5. **Code Linting and Formatting**:
   - Use a linter such as `shellcheck` to catch common issues in shell scripts.

6. **Version Control**:
   - Ensure the script follows a version control system, such as git, with meaningful commit messages.

#### Code Examples for Improvements
Here are a couple of examples where improvements can be made:

**Enhanced Error Messages:**
```bash
error "ollama_chat_json: unable to parse model response: $result"
```

**Refactored Chat Functions:**
```bash
# Generic chat function
ollama_chat_common() {
  local result
  if ! result=$(ollama_api_post "/api/chat" "$json_payload"); then
    error "ollama_chat_common: API call failed with result: [$result]"
    return $RETURN_ERROR
  fi

  # Extract and sanitize response content
  if ! content=$(json_sanitize "$result" | jq -r ".message.content") || [ -z "$content" ]; then
    error "ollama_chat_common: failed to extract message content"
    return $RETURN_ERROR
  fi

  ollama_messages_add "assistant" "$content"
  echo "$result"
}
```

**Dynamic Help Messages:**
Using `help.sh` script or similar:
```bash
# Load help.sh (assuming it's a helper script for generating help messages)
. ./help.sh

# Generate and print function help
ollama_chat_common_help "$OLLAMA_LIB_VERSION" "Ollama Bash Lib"
```

By addressing these points, the script can be made more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly.
