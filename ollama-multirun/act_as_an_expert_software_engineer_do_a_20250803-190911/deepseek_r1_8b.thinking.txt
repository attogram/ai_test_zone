We are going to review the provided bash script for the Ollama Bash Lib.
 The goal is to provide a code review with suggestions and best practices.

 Let's break down the script into sections:

 1. Global variables (metadata, configuration)
 2. Internal functions (debug, error)
 3. API functions (ollama_api_get, ollama_api_post, etc.)
 4. Generate functions (ollama_generate_json, ollama_generate_stream_json, etc.)
 5. Messages functions
 6. Chat functions
 7. List functions
 8. Model functions
 9. Processes functions
10. Show functions
11. Ollama functions (installed, version)
12. Utility function (estimate_tokens)
13. Lib functions (about, version)

 We'll go through each section and note issues or improvements.

 Important: We must remember that bash scripts have limitations and best practices for safety and clarity.
