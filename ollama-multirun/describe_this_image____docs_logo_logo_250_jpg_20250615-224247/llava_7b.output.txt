 This is an illustration of three alpacas standing in front of a server rack. The alpaca on the left is looking to its right, while the two on the right are looking forward. All three have a pinkish color with darker ears and faces. They are inside what appears to be a data center or IT room, as indicated by the server racks filled with hardware in the background. The alpacas are anthropomorphized, standing upright like humans, and their expressions are not typical for animals; they seem to mimic human emotions or postures. There is no text present in the image.
