<think>
Okay, I need to write a JavaScript function that takes an array and outputs an HTML list of its contents. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should consider how HTML lists are structured. In HTML, a list can be created using either a <ul> tag with <li> elements or a <ol> tag with lines inside it. But for simplicity, maybe using a <ul> with li tags is easier for now.

So the function will take an array as input. Let's name the function something like createHtmlList, and it'll be called something like showArrayAsHTML.

Inside this function, I'll start by creating a div element because that's common in web pages. Then, within that div, I'll create a ul ()<=list> tag to encapsulate the list of items.

Next, for each item in the input array, I'll need to wrap it in a li ()<=li>= tag. But wait, how do I display these li elements inside the parent div? Maybe each li should be directly child of the parent div. Alternatively, perhaps using inline HTML within the div would work better.

Another approach is to create an unordered list with each item as a list item. So maybe wrapping the array in an <ul> and adding each item as a <li> element inside it.

Wait, perhaps the simplest way is to create a div that contains an unordered list. Each item from the array will be a list item in this list. So the structure would be something like:

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>item1</li>
    <li>item2</li>
    ...
  </ol>
</div>

So for the function, I'll loop through each element in the input array and add each as a list item inside an unordered list.

Now, how to implement this in JavaScript. The function will look like this:

function showArrayAsHTML(array) {
  const htmlList = document.createElement('ul');
  htmlList.appendChild(document.body.firstChild); // Or maybe use createHtmlList method from some library? Wait, perhaps using createElement or similar.

Wait, perhaps the best way is to create an unordered list. So within a div, but perhaps better to use a <div> and inside it an <ol> with multiple <li>.

Alternatively, perhaps each item should be in a separate line within the HTML. Maybe using table rows or something else isn't necessary.

Let me structure the function step by step:

1. Create a new document to avoid any DOM manipulation issues.
2. Create an unordered list (ul) element.
3. For each item in the input array, create a li element and append it to the ul.
4. Append the entire ul to a div or directly include it within the parent container.

Wait, perhaps using HTML entities might be complicated. Maybe just wrap each item as a separate line inside an unordered list.

So here's a possible approach:

- Create a new document body.
- For each element in the array, create an li element and append it to the ul.
- Then, add the entire ul to the document body as a div or perhaps just include it directly.

But maybe using a more straightforward method. Let's think about how to write this code.

First, I'll need to get all the elements from the array and wrap them in an unordered list. So:

function showArrayAsHTML(array) {
  const htmlList = document.createElement('ul');
  for (let item of array) {
    htmlList.appendChild(document.createElement('li')).appendChild(item);
  }
  // Or perhaps create a li with each item.
  // Wait, another way: use the array's elements as list items.

Wait, maybe using array.map to create the list items. So:

function showArrayAsHTML(array) {
  const htmlList = document.createElement('ul');
  for (const item of array) {
    htmlList.appendChild(document.createElement('li')).appendChild(item);
  }
  return htmlList;
}

But perhaps that's not necessary because each li can be added directly.

Alternatively, considering the structure:

We can create a list using the <ul> tag and then loop through each element in the array to add them as <li> elements inside this <ul>.

So putting it all together:

The function will do the following steps:

1. Create a new document.
2. Create an unordered list (ul) element within the document's root.
3. For each item in the input array, create a li element and append it to the ul.
4. Return this HTML structure.

But wait, perhaps it's better to use the <div> container instead of <ul> for simplicity. Alternatively, maybe I should just return an unordered list with each item as a separate line.

Another approach is to have each array item be a separate element in the list. So perhaps using something like:

function createHtmlList(array) {
  const html = document.createElement('ul');
  html.innerHTML = '';
  for (const item of array) {
    const liElement = document.createElement('li');
    liElement.textContent = item;
    html.appendChild(liElement);
  }
  return html;
}

But wait, the function is supposed to take an array and output a HTML list. So perhaps this approach would work.

Testing with example: if the input is [1,2,3], the output should be:

<ul>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>3</li>
</ul>

So in code:

function showArrayAsHTML(array) {
  let html = document.createElement('ul');
  for (let item of array) {
    html.appendChild(document.createElement('li')).appendChild(item);
  }
  return html;
}

Wait, but perhaps it's better to use the createHtmlList method from a library like 'html' or something, but since this is code submission, I'll assume that using basic HTML elements is sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps each array item should be placed on its own line without any wrapping. So maybe inside a <div> with some style.

But perhaps for simplicity, the initial approach of creating an unordered list with li elements inside it would work.

So putting all together, the function will create an empty ul, loop through each element in the input array, add each as a li element to the ul, and return the resulting HTML string.

Wait, but how? Because when we create the HTML, perhaps using <ul> tags directly. But maybe it's better to have the function return the actual HTML elements without relying on DOM manipulation for now.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that in some contexts, like in a browser, writing code manually is error-prone, and perhaps using an existing library or method would be better. However, since this is a function to write for submission, I'll proceed with basic HTML elements.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Create a new document object.
2. Create an unordered list (ul) element in this document.
3. For each item in the input array:
   a. Create a li element and append it to the ul.
4. Return the created html content, which is the entire ul.

So putting that into code:

function showArrayAsHTML(array) {
  let html = document.createElement('ul');
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    const liElement = document.createElement('li');
    liElement.textContent = array[i];
    html.appendChild(liElement);
  }
  return html;
}

Wait, but this would create an unordered list with each item as a separate line. So when the user renders this HTML, it will display correctly.

Testing this function: if I pass [1,2,3], it will output:

<ul>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>3</li>
</ul>

Which is correct.

Now, what about empty array? It should return an empty list. But perhaps that's acceptable.

Another test case: if the input is [], then html remains empty.

I think this approach works. So I can write the function as described.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to create a JavaScript function that takes an array and outputs a HTML list of its contents. The goal is to convert each element in the array into a structured HTML element within a list format.

### Approach
1. **Create an Unordered List**: We will use an unordered list (ul) tag in HTML to encapsulate our content.
2. **Loop Through Array Elements**: For each element in the input array, we will create a `<li>` (list item) element and append it to the unsorted list.
3. **Construct HTML String**: We will build the HTML string by starting with an empty `<ul>`, then adding each array element as a `<li>` within this structure.

This approach ensures that each element from the input array is properly encapsulated within a list, making it easy for users to display the array content in a structured format.

### Solution Code
```javascript
function showArrayAsHTML(array) {
    let html = document.createElement('ul');
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        const liElement = document.createElement('li');
        liElement.textContent = array[i];
        html.appendChild(liElement);
    }
    return html;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Creating Unordered List**: The function starts by creating an empty `<ul>` element in a new document. This will serve as the container for our list of items.
- **Looping Through Array**: For each element in the input array, we create a `<li>` element and append it to the existing `<ul>`. Each `<li>` is populated with the corresponding array element.
- **Returning HTML Content**: The constructed HTML structure is then returned. When this HTML content is displayed in a web page, it will show an unordered list where each item from the input array appears as a separate list item.

This method ensures that the array is converted into a readable HTML list format, making it easy to display multiple items in a structured manner.
