Thinking...
Okay, so I need to figure out how many 'r's are in the word "Strawberry". Let me start by writing down the word to visualize it better. S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y.

Hmm, let me check each letter one by one. The first letter is S, then T, then R. So that's the first 'r'. Then the next letters are A, W, B, E, R, R, Y. So after the initial R, there's another R and another R. Wait, so in the word "Strawberry", is there a third R? Let me count again.

Breaking it down: S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. So the letters are S, T, R, A, W, B, E, R, R, Y. So the R's are in positions 3, 8, and 9. So that's three R's? Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any. Let me spell it out again:

S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Yes, so after the first R (position 3), there's another R at position 8, and another at position 9. So that's three R's. But wait, sometimes people might miscount. Let me check again. Maybe I miscounted the letters. Let me count the letters in "Strawberry" to make sure.

Strawberry has 10 letters. Let's count them:

1. S
2. T
3. R
4. A
5. W
6. B
7. E
8. R
9. R
10. Y

Yes, that's 10 letters. So the R's are at positions 3, 8, and 9. So three R's. But wait, sometimes when you spell words, you might have a different number. Let me confirm by looking at the spelling again. "Strawberry" is spelled S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. So between the first R and the second R, there's a space, but the letters are S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. So the third letter is R, then after that, there's another R and another R. So yes, three R's. Therefore, the answer should be 3.

But wait, I just thought—maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if there's a typo in the word. Is "Strawberry" spelled with three R's? Let me verify. The word "strawberry" is spelled S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Yes, that's correct. So there are three R's. So the answer is 3.

But wait, another way to check is to write out the word and count each letter. Let's do that:

S (1), T (2), R (3), A (4), W (5), B (6), E (7), R (8), R (9), Y (10). So the R's are at positions 3, 8, 9. So three R's. Yep, that's consistent. So the answer is 3.

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So the number of R's in "Strawberry" is three.
...done thinking.

To determine how many **r's** are in the word **"Strawberry"**, we can break down the word letter by letter:

**S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y**

Let's identify the positions of the letters and count the **r's**:

1. **S**  
2. **T**  
3. **R** ✅  
4. **A**  
5. **W**  
6. **B**  
7. **E**  
8. **R** ✅  
9. **R** ✅  
10. **Y**

From this breakdown, we see that the **r's** are located at positions 3, 8, and 9. Therefore, there are **three r's** in the word.
