Okay, so I need to figure out how many times the letter 'r' appears in the word "Strawberry." Hmm, let me start by writing down the word and then going through each letter one by one. 

The word is "Strawberry." Let's break it down:

S, t, r, a, w, b, e, r, r, y.

Wait, actually, maybe I should spell it out correctly without mixing up the letters. Let me write each letter step by step:

1. S
2. T
3. R
4. A
5. W
6. B
7. E
8. R
9. R
10. Y

Wait, no, that seems off because "Strawberry" should have more letters. Let me double-check the spelling of "Strawberry." Hmm, maybe it's better to write it out properly.

The word is: S T R A W B E R R Y? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps it's better to just list each letter in order without making assumptions about the spelling.

Let me take "Strawberry" and count each letter:

S - first letter
T - second
R - third
A - fourth
W - fifth
B - sixth
E - seventh
R - eighth
R - ninth
Y - tenth

Wait, so from S to Y, that's ten letters. Let me write them out:

1. S
2. T
3. R
4. A
5. W
6. B
7. E
8. R
9. R
10. Y

So now, looking at this list, let's identify each 'r'. Starting from the third letter: 

- Third letter is R (letter 3)
- Then we have an R at position 8 (letter 8)
- And another R at position 9 (letter 9)

Wait, so that would make three Rs? Let me check again.

The word "Strawberry" can be broken down as follows:

S T R A W B E R R Y

So breaking it into individual letters: S, T, R, A, W, B, E, R, R, Y. That's 10 letters in total. Now let's count the 'R's.

Looking at each letter:

- Position 3: R
- Position 8: R
- Position 9: R

So that's three Rs. Therefore, the word "Strawberry" contains three 'r's.

But hold on, perhaps I made a mistake because sometimes in words there might be more than one instance. Let me recount:

Starting from the beginning:

1. S - not an r
2. T - not an r
3. R - yes, that's one r
4. A - no
5. W - no
6. B - no
7. E - no
8. R - yes, second r
9. R - yes, third r
10. Y - no

So that gives us three 'r's in total.

Therefore, the number of 'r's in "Strawberry" is 3.

The word "Strawberry" consists of the letters S, T, R, A, W, B, E, R, R, Y. By examining each letter, we find that there are three instances of the letter 'R'. 

**Answer:** The number of 'r's in "Strawberry" is 3.
