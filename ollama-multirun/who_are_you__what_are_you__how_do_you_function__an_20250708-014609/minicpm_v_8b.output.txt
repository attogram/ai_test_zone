I am a machine learning model called ChatGPT. I was trained on a large dataset of human-generated text to understand natural language processing (NLP) better.
My primary objective is to generate human-like responses based on the input provided by users in real-time chat conversations, emails or any other form of communication where humans interact with machines using NLP techniques.
I function through deep learning algorithms and can learn from my interactions with users. I use a combination of neural networks, transformers, and attention mechanisms to understand context, meaning, and intent behind user queries. With each interaction, I adjust my responses based on feedback received or learned during training phases so as improve over time.
My capabilities include understanding language nuances like sarcasm or irony; detecting emotions in text expressions such as anger or happiness; summarizing long passages of texts quickly while maintaining their overall meaning accurately; generating creative content including poetry and stories among others. However, I do have limitations related to bias towards certain cultures or groups which could be mitigated through further training data diversification.
Ultimately, my aim is to assist users by providing quick responses that are relevant, accurate, helpful, friendly yet unbiased when possible without revealing personal information about them unless explicitly requested in a context-specific manner.
