This is the core of a good business. We need to know the business, know who we are, what we stand for. These questions make us feel heard and cared about our product or service. It makes us happy and gives us confidence in working with the company. You’ll be surprised how easy it can get to understand who you are when your customers talk to you.

You don’t have to put up a face for yourself, but it helps. The more people know what you do, the easier your customers will find out about you. This is not only true for potential clients; it will also help you grow into a great leader in your industry or company.
