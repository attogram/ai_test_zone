Here's a simple ASCII art of a rabbit, inspired by your example but with a fresh design:

```
         ,
        /|      __
       / |   ,-~ /
      Y :|  //  /
      | jj /( .^
      >-"~"-v"
     /       Y
    jo  o    |
   ( ~T~     j
    >._-' _./
   /   "~"  |
  Y     _,  |
 /| ;-"~ _  l
/ l/ ,-"~    \
\//\/      .- \
 Y        /    Y
 l       I     !
 ]\      _\    /"\
(" ~----( ~   Y.  ) /think
```

This version includes a more streamlined structure, with clear body, ears, tail, and eyes. The design focuses on symmetry and detail, similar to your example but with a slightly different layout. Let me know if you'd like a different style or addition!
