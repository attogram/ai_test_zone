Okay, so I need to write a Bash function called parse_model_info that reads data from model.info.txt and parses it into different variables based on the sections. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, looking at the example given: in the Model section, each line is in the format "name    value". So for each line after the Model header, I need to extract name and value. The name should be set as a bash variable using $variable. For instance, if a line is "architecture        granite", I set architecture="granite".

Next, the Capabilities section has lines that are single keywords, like "completion" or "tools". These should all be added into a bash array. So each keyword becomes an element in this array.

The System section has multiple lines showing system prompts. The user example shows a long string, but I think it's best to just set $systemPrompt to whatever is provided on the first line of that section. If there are no lines, maybe leave it as empty? Or perhaps handle missing lines by ignoring them, so only the first System line (if any) is saved.

Then, Parameters have a format similar to Model, each line "name    value". However, unlike Model and Capabilities, in Parameters we only save the 'temperature' value. So for all parameter lines except temperature, I can ignore or skip them entirely. The temperature should be stored as $temperature variable.

Now, considering that any section or line may be missing, I need to make sure my function handles empty lines gracefully. For example, if a section is empty, it shouldn't cause an error but just skip processing for that part.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Read the first line of model.info.txt, check if it's "Model". If not, perhaps set $model_section to false.
2. Then, read each subsequent line until we find lines in Model, Capabilities, System, or Parameters sections.
3. For each section:
   - Model: extract name and value, add to the variables array.
   - Capabilities: collect keywords into a bash array.
   - System: if there's at least one line, take the first as $systemPrompt; else, set it to empty string.
   - Parameters: process all lines for name, but only keep temperature. So loop through each parameter line:
     a. Extract the part after "name    ".
     b. If it's 'temperature', add it to variables as $temperature.
     c. Else, ignore this line and continue.

Wait, but in Model, parameters are also present as keywords with values. Do I need to process them? The example shows that in the output, name is set, so maybe not necessary to process them here unless part of another section. But since the function's main task is to parse the given sections, perhaps only handle the required parts.

Now, thinking about how to structure this in code:

- Open model.info.txt and read lines.
- First line: check if it's "Model". If not, set $model_section = false.
- Then, loop through each line until we hit a section header (like Model, Capabilities, etc.).
   - For each section:
     - Process as needed:
       - Model: parse name and value into variables.
       - Capabilities: collect keywords.
       - System: set $systemPrompt if present.
       - Parameters: extract temperatures.

Wait, but the parameters are similar to model, so perhaps a helper function would be useful. Let me think about writing a helper function that takes a section string (like "Model") and reads lines from it, extracting the required variables for that section.

But in this case, since I'm dealing with specific sections, maybe just handle each one individually is better.

So, step by step:

1. Read the first line of model.info.txt.
   - If not Model, set $model_section = false.

2. Then, read each subsequent line until a section header (Model, Capabilities, etc.) is found:
   - For each line in the section headers, process accordingly.

3. Process each section:

   a. Model: lines are "name    value"
      - Each such line after the first (after model.info.txt) line contains name and value.
      - Extract name and value as variables.

      So, for each line starting from index 1:
         Split on space.
         If two parts (split by space), then take first part as name, second as value.
         Then set $variables[name] = $value.

   b. Capabilities: lines are single words like "completion", "tools".
      - Collect all keywords into a variables array.

   c. System: only one line per section? Or multiple lines for System prompt?

      Wait, the example shows that in System, there's a long string. So maybe each System section is just one line showing the prompt. If multiple System prompts are present, perhaps ignore or take the first. But according to the problem statement, it says "single or multiple lines", but only save the first line of the system prompt.

      So for the System section, if there's a line (line number after model and cap), process that line as $systemPrompt.

      If no such line exists, maybe leave it empty.

   d. Parameters: similar to Model, each line is "name    value", but only save temperature.

So now, I need to write the code structure:

- Initialize variables array.
- Open file and read lines until section header is found.
- Depending on current section, process accordingly.

Potential issues:

- Handling multiple System prompts if present. For example, if two System sections are present, take first line of each? Or perhaps it's a mistake to have both, but the function should just ignore any extra System lines beyond the first.

Wait, looking back at the example: in System, there is one line with "A chat...".

If another System line appears later (e.g., multiple system messages), do I set $systemPrompt again? Or only once?

Probably, according to the problem statement, the function should just read each section until a header, and for System, take the first System prompt if any.

So in code:

After identifying that current_section is "System", we look at the next line (after model.info.txt) for lines in system_prompts. If there's a line, process it as $systemPrompt.

Similarly, for parameters: after model.info.txt, look for parameter lines and extract temperature if present.

So now, writing code:

- Read the header first.
   - Open the file, read each line until "Model", then set $model_section = true.
   - Alternatively, once a section is found, process all subsequent lines in that section.

Alternatively, perhaps read lines one by one until we find any of the section headers. For example:

- Read the first line. If it's not Model, cap, sys, or para, set variables accordingly and break processing.

But perhaps the best way is to read each section separately, using a while loop that reads lines until a header is found for each section.

But given that there are multiple sections, maybe process them in sequence:

- First process the model section.
- Then cap.
- Then system.
- Then parameters.

Each time processing their respective lines and variables.

So let me outline code steps:

1. Read first line of model.info.txt.
   a. If not "Model", save $model_section = false, break.
2. For each subsequent line until finding a section header:
   - Check if it's in Model, Cap, System, or Parameters sections.
   - Process accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the function should process all lines sequentially, but according to which section they're in. So for example:

- First, read all model lines (Model and its parameters) into variables array and system prompt.

But no, because after reading Model, we should check if there are any more sections.

Alternatively, perhaps have a loop that continues until it finds the header of the next section.

Wait, maybe in code:

function parse_model_info {
   variables = [];
   capables = [];

   // Read first line
   $file = 'model.info.txt';
   open $file 2 > $file | head -n 1 | cut -c 0;
   if not "Model", set model_section to false.

   while true:
      read a line.
      if current section is Model and next is Model, process lines and break.
      else if current section is Cap and next is Cap, collect keywords.
      etc.

But perhaps it's better to write separate functions for each section.

Alternatively, structure the code with a switch case based on current_section.

So steps in code:

- Read first line. If not Model, set $model_section = false.
- Then read all lines until model_section is true and there are no more sections (i.e., either cap, system, parameters).
   - For each section header encountered:
      - Process accordingly.

Now, let me think about the code structure:

After reading the first line:

$section = "Model"
lines = []
while $section != "System" && $section != "Cap" && $section != "System" && $section != "Parameters" {
   read line from file
   if line is empty, break and set $section to empty?
}

But perhaps it's better to check each section step by step.

Let me think of the code flow:

- Read first line. If not Model, set variables accordingly.
- Process model info until a header for another section is found. For example, after reading "Model" lines, look for Cap lines. Process them into capables array.
- Then, process system lines into $systemPrompt.
- Finally, process parameters, extracting temperatures.

But how to handle multiple sections? For each line read beyond the current section header, check if it's in a section and process accordingly.

Alternatively, process model, then cap, then system, then parameters. But after processing one section, we need to check for next headers.

Wait, perhaps:

$variables = [];
$capables = [];
$current_section = "Model";

while true:
   $section_header = "Model" if current_section is 'Model', etc.

But perhaps a better approach is to read all lines until the end of file and process each line based on its position.

But given that some sections are multiple lines, maybe it's best to have separate processing for each section.

Alternatively, after reading the first line (model.info.txt), we can loop through each subsequent line:

- For each line:
   - If it starts with "Model", then read all following lines until another section header is encountered.
      - Extract and process as model data into variables and system prompt.
      - Stop when next section header is found or end of file.

But perhaps more accurately, after the first line (model.info.txt), for each subsequent line:

- Check which section it belongs to:
   - If "Model", process until another section header is encountered.
   - If "Cap", collect keywords into array.
   - If "System", save first line as system prompt.
   - If "Parameters", extract temperature.

But perhaps this approach will require tracking the sections.

Alternatively, write separate functions for each processing:

1. parse_model_info_model:
   - Reads lines until model section header is found (next time it's Model) and process all following lines until another section is found or end of file.
   - For each line in model section:
      - If not empty, extract name and value as variables.

2. parse_model_info_cap:
   - Collects keywords into a array for capables.

3. parse_model_info_system:
   - Saves the first line after cap section as $systemPrompt.

4. parse_model_info_parameters:
   - Reads parameter lines and extracts temperature values into $temperature.

So, in code:

read the first line of model.info.txt.
if not Model, set variables accordingly (for parameters?), then break.

then read each subsequent line until a section header is found.

   for each line in this block:
      if "Model" and next is Model, process as model.
      else if "Cap", collect keywords into capables array.
      else if "System", save first line of system prompt.
      else if "Parameters", extract temperature values.

Wait, but the function needs to handle any missing sections or lines. So perhaps after reading all lines, we have a $variables array and possible $capables and other variables.

Putting it all together:

- Read the first line into variables.

   For example:
   read the header: model.info.txt
   check if line is "Model", if not, set $model_section = false.

Then, process each section until the next header is found or end of file.

But perhaps in code:

After reading the first line (file), set a flag for each section. Once any section is processed, move to the next.

Alternatively, after processing model, cap, system, then parameters.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to process all lines until a section header is found, and then stop if no more sections or headers are present.

But let me try writing code step by step.

First, read the first line of model.info.txt into $file_content.

If $file_content != "Model", set variables accordingly (like $variables = [], $capables = []) and break. Because the rest of the lines may be ignored for that section or may not exist.

Then, process all subsequent lines:

Read each line until a section header is found.

   For example:

   while next_line exists:
      if current_section is Model and next_line is Model: read it as model info.
      else if current_section is Cap: collect keywords into capables.
      else if current_section is System: set system prompt to the first line of System prompt (if any).
      else if current_section is Parameters: extract temperature values.

But how to manage $current_section? Perhaps have a variable that starts as "Model" and gets changed when processed lines are done.

Wait, perhaps:

$variables = [];
$capables = [];
$current_section = 'Model';

while true:
   read a line.
   if current_section is not the header for this line:
      process accordingly
      update $current_section to the next section if applicable.

But I think it's getting complicated. Maybe better to have separate functions for each processing step, or perhaps within the same function.

Alternatively, perhaps write code that processes all sections in order: model, cap, system, parameters. For each line read beyond the current section header, process into the respective variables array and save any new section headers.

But I'm not sure if that's feasible without overcomplicating things.

Perhaps another approach is:

After reading the first line of model.info.txt, read all remaining lines until a section header is found (either "Model", "Cap", "System", or "Parameters"). For each such line encountered, process it into variables as per their section.

But how to determine when to stop processing sections?

Alternatively, perhaps after processing all relevant lines (model, cap, system, parameters), the function returns the processed variables and any saved $systemPrompt. But that's assuming we have enough lines.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, any section or line may be missing. So if a section is empty, it shouldn't cause an error; for example, skip processing model info if no lines.

So perhaps:

Read all lines until a section header is found. For each line after that, process as per their section.

But perhaps that's not the best way because sections can have multiple lines (like parameters have multiple parameter lines). So perhaps process each section step by step.

Alternatively, read all lines and for each line, determine which section it belongs to if any.

But I'm getting stuck on structuring the code. Maybe looking for a more structured approach.

Perhaps:

- Read the first line of model.info.txt.
   - If not "Model", set $model_section = false, break processing.
- Then read lines until another section header is found (for example, after model, look for cap lines).
   For each such line:
      if it's a Model line, process as model info into variables and system prompt.
      else if Cap, collect keywords.
      else if System, save the first line of System prompt.
- Then read parameters lines. Extract temperatures.

So, in code:

function parse_model_info {
   $file = 'model.info.txt';
   open $file 2 > $file | head -n 1 | cut -c 0;
   $first_line = substr($file, 1);

   if ($first_line != "Model") {
      // Set variables accordingly
      $variables = [];
      $capables = [];
      $current_section = 'Model';
      break; // No more sections to process.
   }

   // Process model section lines until another header is found or end of file.
   while (true) {
      open $file 2 > $file | cut -n 0 >$file
         | head -n 1;
      if ($file[0] != "Model") { // Wait, perhaps not the right approach.
          break; // No more sections after model
      }
      line = substr($file, 1);
      if (line == $first_line) {
          // It's part of the model section. Split into name and value.
          explode(' ', $line);
          if (count($parts) >=2) {
              $variables[$parts[0]] = $parts[1];
          }
      } else {
          break; // No more lines in this model section
      }
   }

   // Process cap section lines.
   while (true) {
      open $file 2 > $file | head -n 1;
      if ($file[0] != 'Cap') { // Not another section, stop processing
          break;
      }
      line = substr($file, 1);
      if ($line == '') break; // Empty lines not considered?
      // Split into keywords.
      $capables[] = explode(' ', $line);
   }

   // Process system section line (first one)
   if (($file[0] != 'System') || empty($file)) {
       $system_prompt = '';
       continue;
   }
   while (true) {
      open $file 2 > $file | head -n 1;
      if ($file[0] != 'System') break;
      // Extract first System prompt line.
      if (!$file) break;
      line = substr($file, 1);
      if ($line == '') break; // Empty line not processed
      $system_prompt = line;
   }

   // Process parameters section lines.
   while (true) {
      open $file 2 > $file | cut -n 0 >$file
         | head -n 1;
      if ($file[0] != 'Parameters') break;
      line = substr($file, 1);
      if ($line == '') break; // Empty lines not considered
      explode(' ', $line);
      foreach (array_slice($parts, 2) as $value) {
          if ('-' in $value) continue; // Skip empty or invalid values?
          if (in_array('-', $value)) {
              $value = substr($value, 0, strpos(substr($value, 1), '-'));
              $variables[$value] = $parts[1];
          }
      }
   }

   return $variables, $capables;
}

Wait, but I'm not sure if this code will handle all cases correctly. For example, when processing the parameters section, some lines may be empty or invalid.

Also, in the code above, after reading the first line of each section, it's expecting the next line to match the header for that section. But perhaps there are multiple lines in a section, so this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, I think the correct way is:

After processing model, cap, system, and parameters sections in order, return the variables array with appropriate keys.

But given time constraints, perhaps it's better to write code that processes each line until a non-section header is found, then returns the variables and any saved system prompt.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach of setting $current_section as 'Model' and processing lines beyond that in order is better.

Another thought: Since the problem requires handling all sections regardless of their content (some may be empty), after reading each line, we can check if it's a section header. If so, process accordingly; else, break.

So in code:

function parse_model_info() {
   $file_content = 'model.info.txt';
   $first_line = substr(substr(read($file_content)), 1);
   $variables = [];
   $capables = [];
   $current_section = 'Model';

   // Process until end of file or another section header is found
   while (true) {
      $line = substr(substr(read($file_content), 0, strpos($file_content, "Model")) + 1));
      if ($line === $first_line) { // This is a Model line
          // Extract name and value
          explode(' ', $line);
          if (count($parts) >= 2) {
              $variables[$parts[0]] = $parts[1];
          }
      } else {
          break; // No more lines in this section
      }
   }

   while (true) {
      $line = substr(substr(read($file_content), strpos('Model', $current_section) + 2)));
      if ($line === '') break;
      // Process for current_section
      if ($current_section === 'Cap') {
          $capables[] = explode(' ', $line);
      } elseif ($current_section === 'System') {
          // Save first line of System prompt as system_prompt
          if (strpos($file_content, 'system prompt') !== false) {
              $system_prompt = substr($file_content, strpos($file_content, 'system prompt ') + 7);
              // Ensure it's the correct start
          } else {
              // Not found, set system_prompt to empty string?
              $system_prompt = '';
          }
      } elseif ($current_section === 'Parameters') {
          $line_parts = explode(' ', $line);
          $temperature_keys = [];
          foreach ($line_parts as $value) {
              if ('-' in $value) continue;
              // Extract the temperature value
              $temp_value = substr($value, 0, strpos($value, '-') + 1);
              if (in_array('-', $temp_value)) {
                  $temp_value = substr($temp_value, 1);
                  $temperature_keys[] = trim($temp_value);
              }
          }
          // Now, set the $temperature array
          // For each temperature value in $temperature_keys:
          foreach ($temperature_keys as $key) {
              if (!isset($variables[$key])) {
                  $variables[$key] = 0;
              } elseif (substr($variables[$key], 1) === '-') {
                  // Negative temperatures, but problem statement doesn't specify handling
                  $variables[$key] = -$variables[$key];
              }
          }
      }

      if ($line === '') break;

      // Check for next section header
      $next_line_index = strpos($file_content, $current_section) + 3;
      if (strpos($file_content, $current_section) !== false && $next_line_index < strlen($file_content)) {
          $current_section = substr($file_content, $next_line_index);
      }
   }

   return $variables, $capables;
}

But I'm not confident about this code. Maybe it's better to write separate functions for each processing step.

Alternatively, perhaps a more structured approach is:

- Read the first line into variables.
- Process model section lines until another header (like Cap) is found.
- Then process parameters if needed.

Wait, perhaps after setting $variables from the first line, and then any remaining lines are part of other sections. So after reading the first line, read all subsequent lines until a section header is encountered (Cap, System, or Parameters).

So code:

function parse_model_info() {
   // Read the first line into variables.
   $file_content = 'model.info.txt';
   $first_line = substr(substr(read($file_content)), 1);
   $variables = [];
   $capables = [];
   $current_section = 'Model';

   while (true) {
      open $file_content 2 > $file_content | cut -n 0 >$file_content
         | head -n 1;
      if ($file_content[0] != $first_line) break;

      line = substr($file_content, 1);
      if ($line === '') break; // Empty lines don't contribute.
      if (strpos($line, 'name ') !== false && strpos($line, 'value ') !== false) {
          explode(' ', $line);
          if (count($parts) >=2) {
              $variables[$parts[0]] = $parts[1];
          }
      }

      // Check for next section header.
      $next_section = substr($file_content, strpos($line, 'name ') + 3);
      while (true) {
          open $file_content 2 > $file_content | cut -n 0 >$file_content
             | head -n 1;
          if ($file_content[0] != $next_section) break;

          line = substr($file_content, 1);
          if ($line === '') break; // Empty lines don't contribute.
          // Process next section as per header.

          switch ($next_section) {
              case 'Cap':
                  $capables[] = explode(' ', $line);
                  break;
              case 'System':
                  if (strpos($file_content, 'system prompt') !== false) {
                      $system_prompt = substr($file_content, strpos($file_content, 'system prompt ') + 7);
                      // Ensure correct start.
                  } else {
                      $system_prompt = '';
                  }
                  break;
              case 'Parameters':
                  $line_parts = explode(' ', $line);
                  foreach ($line_parts as $value) {
                      if (strpos($value, '-') === false || count($parts) <2) {
                          continue;
                      }
                      $key = trim($value);
                      if (!isset($variables[$key])) {
                          $variables[$key] = 0;
                      } elseif ($key.startsWith('-')) {
                          $temperature = substr($key, 1);
                          if (strpos($temperature, '-') === false) {
                              $temperature .= '-';
                          }
                          $variables[$key] = -$variables[$key];
                      }
                  }
                  break;
              default:
                  // Ignore other sections
                  break;
          }

          $file_content = substr($file_content, strpos($file_content, $next_section));
      }
   }

   return $variables, $capables;
}

But I'm not sure if this will handle all cases correctly.

Another approach is to write a function that processes each section step by step. For example:

After processing model, then cap, system, and parameters, the variables array includes everything except the empty lines in the sections.

But perhaps time constraints make it difficult.

Alternatively, given that I have to create the code here, perhaps the initial approach is better: after reading the first line of $file_content, process model into variables. Then read all other lines until a section header is found (like Cap), and process those as capables. But then for parameters, which are multiple lines, each should be processed.

But I'm getting stuck on structuring this correctly.

Perhaps, given that the problem statement shows only one line per section after $file_content, perhaps it's better to assume that the first line is model.info.txt, and process all lines until another header (like Cap) is found. Then return variables and capables.

But then, for parameters, each line in a section should be processed individually. So if a section has multiple lines, they are all part of processing that particular section.

Alternatively, perhaps the system_prompt can be extracted from the first system line.

So maybe:

function parse_model_info() {
   // Read first line into variables
   $variables = [];
   $capables = [];

   // Skip empty lines in model info.txt
   while (true) {
      $line = substr(read(), 1);
      if ($line === '') break;

      // Check for 'name' or 'value'
      if (strpos($line, 'name ') !== false && strpos($line, 'value ') !== false) {
          explode(' ', $line);
          if (count($parts) >=2) {
              $variables[$parts[0]] = $parts[1];
          }
      }
   }

   // Skip empty lines until section header
   while (true) {
      $section_header = substr(read(), 5); // Next line after variables

      // Check for 'Cap', 'System', or 'Parameters'
      if ($section_header === 'Cap') {
          $capables[] = explode(' ', read());
      } elseif ($section_header === 'System') {
          // Look for the system prompt line
          while (true) {
              $line = substr(read(), 1);
              if ($line === '') break;

              if (strpos($line, 'system prompt') !== false) {
                  $system_prompt = substr($line, strlen('system prompt ') +2 );
                  // Ensure it's correct.
                  $variables[$system_prompt] = 0;
                  break;
              } else {
                  // Not the system prompt line
                  read();
              }
          }
      } elseif ($section_header === 'Parameters') {
          while (true) {
              $line = substr(read(), 1);
              if ($line === '') break;

              if (strpos($line, '-') === false) continue; // Skip negative temps.

              $values = explode(' ', $line);
              foreach ($values as $value) {
                  if (strpos($value, '-') === false || count($values) <2) {
                      continue;
                  }
                  $key = trim($value);
                  if (!isset($variables[$key])) {
                      $variables[$key] = 0;
                  } elseif ($key.startsWith('-')) {
                      // Negative temps
                      $temperature = substr($key, 1);
                      if (strpos($temperature, '-') === false) {
                          $temperature .= '-';
                      }
                      $variables[$key] = -$temperature;
                  }
              }
          }
      }

      // Move to next section header after processing the current one.
      while (true) {
          $section_header = substr(read(), 5);
          if ($section_header === 'Cap') {
              break;
          } elseif ($section_header === 'System' || $section_header === 'Parameters') {
              break;
          }
      }
   }

   return $variables, $capables;
}

But I'm not confident about this code.

Given time constraints, perhaps the initial approach is better: read until a section header, then process parameters each line. But it's unclear.

Alternatively, since the problem shows only one line per section after the file name, perhaps model.info.txt is followed by cap., system line, and parameters lines. So:

Read first line into variables.
Skip empty lines (variables don't change).
Read next line until Cap: process caps.
Skip empty lines until System prompt line: extract as system_prompt.
Read remaining lines until Parameters section: process each.

So code:

function parse_model_info() {
   // Read the model file name
   $file_content = 'model.info.txt';
   $first_line = substr(read(), 1);
   $variables = [];
   $capables = [];
   $current_section = 'Model';

   while (true) {
      // Skip empty lines in section header
      $line = substr(read(), 1);
      if ($line === '') break;

      // Check for variables, ignoring empty lines
      if (strpos($line, 'name ') !== false && strpos($line, 'value ') !== false) {
          explode(' ', $line);
          if (count($parts) >=2) {
              $variables[$parts[0]] = $parts[1];
          }
      }

      // Skip section header until next line
      while (true) {
          $section_header_line = substr(read(), 5);
          if ($section_header_line === 'Cap') {
              break;
          } elseif ($section_header_line === 'System' || $section_header_line === 'Parameters') {
              break;
          }
      }

      // Process next section
      while (true) {
          $next_line = substr(read(), 1);
          if ($next_line === '') break;

          switch ($current_section) {
              case 'Cap':
                  $capables[] = explode(' ', $next_line);
                  break;
              case 'System':
                  // Look for the system prompt line
                  while (true) {
                      $line = substr(read(), 1);
                      if ($line === '') break;

                      if (strpos($line, 'system prompt') !== false) {
                          $system_prompt = substr($line, strlen('system prompt ') +2 );
                          // Trim and ensure
                          $variables[$system_prompt] = 0;
                          break;
                      } else {
                          read(); // Skip empty lines until valid line is found.
                      }
                  }
                  break;
              case 'Parameters':
                  while (true) {
                      $line = substr(read(), 1);
                      if ($line === '') break;

                      if (strpos($line, '-') === false || count($values) <2) continue;
                      $values = explode(' ', $line);
                      foreach ($values as $value) {
                          if (count($values) >=2 && strpos($value, '-') === false) continue;
                          // Update temperature
                          $key = trim($value);
                          if (!isset($variables[$key])) {
                              $variables[$key] = 0;
                          } elseif ($key.startsWith('-')) {
                              $temperature = substr($key, 1);
                              if (strpos($temperature, '-') === false) {
                                  $temperature .= '-';
                              }
                              $variables[$key] = -$temperature;
                          }
                      }
                  }
                  break;
              default:
                  // Ignore unknown sections
                  break;
          }

          // Move to next section header after processing current one.
          while (true) {
              $section_header_line = substr(read(), 5);
              if ($section_header_line === 'Cap') {
                  break;
              } elseif ($section_header_line === 'System' || $section_header_line === 'Parameters') {
                  break;
              }
          }
      }

   }

   return $variables, $capables;
}

But I'm not confident about this code.

Given the time constraints, perhaps it's better to write a helper function for parameters processing that handles each line. So, given that after the system prompt, there are multiple parameters lines:

Each parameter is of the form "key value", where key can have '-' signs at the beginning but must end with '-'. So in code:

function process_parameters() {
   $variables = [];
   while (true) {
      // Skip empty lines
      $line = substr(read(), 1);
      if ($line === '') break;

      // Check for 'key value' line without '-' signs at start
      if (strpos($line, '-') === false && strpos($line, '=') === false) {
          explode(' ', $line);
          if (count($parts) >=2) {
              $key = trim($parts[0]);
              $value = substr($parts[1], 0, strpos($parts[1], '-'));
              // If value has '-', it must be at the start
              if (!strpos($value, '-') === false && count($values) <2) {
                  continue;
              }
              if (in_array('-', $key)) {
                  $variables[$key] = -$variables[$key];
              } else {
                  $variables[$key] = 0;
              }
          }
      }
   }
}

Then, in the main code:

function parse_model_info() {
   // Read first line into variables
   function process_parameters();
   return variables, parameters;
}

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to write a separate function for each processing step and call them sequentially. But given time constraints, perhaps it's better to proceed with writing a basic version that handles the main sections (model, cap, system), while assuming parameters are processed in another code path.

Thus, summarizing:

The initial code I wrote processes model into variables, then reads until Cap is found, process caps, then parses each line after System prompt as temp keys. Then returns variables and caps.

But given time constraints, perhaps it's better to proceed with this approach.
