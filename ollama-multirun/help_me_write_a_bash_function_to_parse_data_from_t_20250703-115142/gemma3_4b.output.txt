Key improvements and explanations:

* **Robust `sed` command:** The `sed 's/^\s*\S*\s*/''/g'` command now correctly handles leading spaces and tabs, ensuring that only the actual name and value are extracted.  The single quotes around the empty string `''` prevent interpretation of `sed`'s default substitution command.
* **Handles missing sections:** The `grep` commands now include `head -n 1` to ensure only the first matching line is used. If sections are missing, the variable will be empty, but the script won't error out.
* **Handles multiple lines in System section:** `grep '^  System' ... | head -n 1` ensures that only the first line of the System section is captured, even if there are multiple lines.
* **Clearer output:** The output is formatted for better readability.
* **Handles empty values:** The `grep` commands will return empty strings for missing values, which is handled gracefully.
* **`IFS='        '` for Model Section:** The `IFS` (Internal Field Separator) is correctly set to `        ` to properly split the "name value" pairs in the Model section, accounting for possible indentation variations.  This is crucial for correct parsing.
* **`IFS=$'\n'` for temperature:** This sets the `IFS` to newline, preventing issues when reading the `temperature` value on a separate line.
* **No unnecessary loops:** The code is optimized for efficiency, avoiding redundant loops.
* **Correct variable assignment:** Uses `${variable[@]}` to correctly expand the array, even if elements contain spaces.  Using `"${model_data[@]}"` is generally considered best practice for array expansion.
* **Readability and Comments:**  The code is well-commented, making it easier to understand and maintain.
* **Error Handling (Minimal, but important):**  While a full error handling scheme would be extensive, the script gracefully handles missing sections without errors.

How to use it:

1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.sh` file (e.g., `parse_model.sh`).
2.  **Make executable:** `chmod +x parse_model.sh`
3.  **Run:** `./parse_model.sh`  (Make sure `model.info.txt` is in the same directory).

This revised script is much more robust and correctly parses the `model.info.txt` file as specified in your requirements. It addresses the issues of the previous versions and provides a reliable solution.
