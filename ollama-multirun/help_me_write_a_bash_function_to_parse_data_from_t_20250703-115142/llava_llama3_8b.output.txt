Here is one possible implementation of the function you requested:
```
#!/bin/bash

# Parse data from a model.info.txt file
parse_model() {
  # Set up an empty array to store capabilities keywords
  local -a capabilities=( )

  # Loop through each line in the Model section
  while read name value; do
    # Save each line as a bash variable with the name and value assigned
    name="$value"
    # Set the variable value to null, so that only the name is saved for future lines
    value=

    # If the next line starts with a dash, it is part of the current name.
    # Otherwise, save the name and value as a capabilities keyword
    if [[ $name == "-" ]]; then
      capabilities+=( $value )
    else
      # Save the name and value to the appropriate variable
      if [[ $name != "" ]]; then
        eval "$name=\"$value\""
      fi
    fi

    # Read the next line
    read -r line -
  done

  # Loop through each line in the Parameters section
  while read name value; do
    # Save only the 'temperature' value to a variable
    if [[ $name == "temperature" ]]; then
      local temperature="$value"
    fi
  done

  # Read the next line to see which section we are in
  read -r line -

  # Loop through each line in the System section, saving each prompt as a variable with
  # the name 'systemPrompt'
  while read line; do
    if [[ $line != "" ]]; then
      local systemPrompt="$line"
    fi
  done

  # Return an array containing capabilities keywords and temperature value
  echo "${capabilities[@]} ${temperature}" | tr '\n' ' '
}
```
You can use the function like this:
```
parse_model model.info.txt
```
Note that the `parse_model` function assumes that the format of the file is consistent with what you described. If your file has a different format, you may need to modify the function accordingly.
