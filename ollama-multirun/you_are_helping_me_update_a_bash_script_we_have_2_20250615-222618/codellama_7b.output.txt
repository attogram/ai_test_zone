Here's an example implementation of the bash script using bash variables:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Read in and parse the stats file
while read -r line; do
  # Get the name and value for each line in the stats file
  name=$(echo "$line" | cut -d ':' -f1)
  value=$(echo "$line" | cut -d ':' -f2)
  
  # Set the bash variable with the same name as the key in the stats file
  eval $name=$value
done < stats.txt

# Read in and parse the show.txt file
while read -r line; do
  case "$line" in
    Model*)
      # Get the name and value for each line in the model section of the show.txt file
      name=$(echo "$line" | cut -d ':' -f1)
      value=$(echo "$line" | cut -d ':' -f2)
      
      # Set the bash variable with the same name as the key in the model section of the show.txt file
      eval $name=$value
    ;;
    Capabilities*)
      # Get the list of capabilities for each line in the capabilities section of the show.txt file
      capabilities=$(echo "$line" | cut -d ':' -f2)
      
      # Set the bash variable with the same name as the key in the capabilities section of the show.txt file
      eval capabilities=$capabilities
    ;;
    Parameters*)
      # Get the name and value for each line in the parameters section of the show.txt file
      name=$(echo "$line" | cut -d ':' -f1)
      value=$(echo "$line" | cut -d ':' -f2)
      
      # Set the bash variable with the same name as the key in the parameters section of the show.txt file
      eval $name=$value
    ;;
  esac
done < show.txt
```
This script uses the `cut` command to extract the name and value for each line in the stats and show files, and then sets a bash variable with the same name as the key in the stats or show file. It also uses the `case` statement to handle the different sections of the show file (model, capabilities, and parameters) and sets the appropriate bash variables accordingly.
