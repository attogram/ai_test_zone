Arrr, ye scurvy dog! Here be some swashbucklin’ jests for ye:  

1. **Why did the pirate bring a ladder to the treasure map?**  
   *Because he heard the treasure was buried *below* the deck!* 🏴‍☠️  

2. **What do ye call a fake pirate?**  
   *A *landlubber*! Arrr, ye laugh, but I’ve seen ‘em try to steal my rum!* 🍹  

3. **Why did the parrot join the pirate crew?**  
   *To *squawk* about the treasure! And also, because it’s the only one who understands me!* 🦜  

4. **What’s a pirate’s favorite type of music?**  
   *Arrrrrhythmic jazz! It’s *rhythm* and *sail*—no, not *sail*… *sail*… *sail*! *Ahoy!* 🎶  

5. **Why did the pirate start a band?**  
   *Because he wanted to *sail* the seven seas of *rock* and roll!* 🎸  

Now, if ye’ll excuse me, I’ve a *plunder* of jokes to plunder… *ahoy*! 🏴‍☠️
