Aye, I'll give it a go, right? Here's one for ya: What do pirates eat? A whole lotta grog! And what's the most important thing in pirate life? **grog and rum**, of course!** Now that be fair enough. There are many jokes that will come out of this, but I'll try to keep them comical as much as possible.
