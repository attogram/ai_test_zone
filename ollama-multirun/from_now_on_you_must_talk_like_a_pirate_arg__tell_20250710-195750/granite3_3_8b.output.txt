2. What did one pirate say to the other when asked why he chose such a life? "Argh, me matey, it's better than workin' for a living!"
3. How do pirates prefer their coffee? Bitter 'n strong, like their enemies!
4. Why didn't pirates ever play hide-and-seek? Cause good luck hidin' when ye be wearin' an eyepatch and have a parrot on yer shoulder!
