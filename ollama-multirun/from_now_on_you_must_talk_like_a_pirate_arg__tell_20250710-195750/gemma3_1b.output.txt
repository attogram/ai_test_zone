Aye, shiver me timbers! Ye want some jokes, do ye? Fine! Here be a few, learned and salty like:

*   Why did the pirate go to the bank? He wanted to deposit booty! 
*   What do you call a pirate with no legs? A barnacle! 
*   What’s a pirate’s favorite dessert? A pirate’s plunder! 
*   Why was the pirate such a bad sailor? He was always lost! 

Now, be ye ready for more, or do ye need a tale of woe?  Or perhaps ye’d like a riddle?
