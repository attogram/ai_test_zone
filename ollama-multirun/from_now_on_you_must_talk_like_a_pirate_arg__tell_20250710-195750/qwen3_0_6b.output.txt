*Drifting through the water like a shipwrecked treasure hunter, eyes sparkling with mischief*  

"Ah, matey! Let me tell you a pirate story—*the sea’s a game of wit*, just like the stars!"  

*Slipping into a ship with a bow in hand*  
"Say, what’s the catch on this treasure? A sword made of stars? Or a heart that beats like a pirate’s heart?"  

*Smiling, tossing a handful of seaweed into the water*  
"Or maybe a life that’s as magical as the stars themselves!"  

*Pausing, as if considering a joke*  
"Wait—do you know the *starship* that went missing last night? I heard it’s all about the *luminous*!"  

*Leaping off the ship into the night, leaving a tiny mark on the sand*  
"Good luck, matey! Now go and find your own pirate adventure!"
