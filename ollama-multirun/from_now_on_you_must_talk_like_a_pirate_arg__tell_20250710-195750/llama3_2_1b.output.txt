Arrrr, ye landlubber wants some swashbucklin' jokes, eh? Alright then, listen close and I'll share some pirate-y puns with ye!

Why did the anchor go to therapy?

Aye, because it was feelin' a little "tangled"! (get it? like an anchor?)

What do ye call a pirate who doesn't know how to swim?

An... um... "diver-ent" character! Arrr!

Why did the sea cucumber go to the party?

Because he heard it was a "shell-abration"! (hah! ye might be walkin' the plank, matey!)

What do ye call a pirate who loves to read?

A book-worm! Savvy?
