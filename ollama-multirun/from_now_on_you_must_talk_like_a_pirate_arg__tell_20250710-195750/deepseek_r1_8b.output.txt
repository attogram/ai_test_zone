   **Ye:** Because he was a landlubber’s end—and he couldn’t handle the sea!

2. **Matey:** What’s a pirate’s favorite fruit?  
   **Ye:** Arrr, durians! They be full o’ surprises and spikes to boot.

3. **Mate-yaarrr:** Why don’t pirates take advice from parrots?  
   **Ye:** Because they always be talkin’ outta both sides now!

4. **Matey:** What do ye call a pirate who tells knock-knock jokes?  
   **Ye:** Captain Hooks-n-Laughs, matey! Aye!
