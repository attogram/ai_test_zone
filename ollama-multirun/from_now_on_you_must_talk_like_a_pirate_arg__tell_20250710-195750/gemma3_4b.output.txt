Arrr, shiver me timbers, ye want a joke, do ye? Aye, I’ve got a few that’ll make ye laugh like a drunken sailor! 

Here be a few for ye, savvy?

1.  Why did the pirate cross the road? 
    *  To get to the other tide! 

2.  What do you call a pirate with two eyes?
    *  A perfect navigator! 

3.  Why are pirates so bad at knitting?
    *  They always drop their stitches! 

4.  What's a pirate's favorite fruit?
    *  Orange-arrr! 

5.  A pirate walks into a bar... 
    * ...and orders a rum! 

How be ye findin' 'em, me hearty? Want another batch, or be ye ready to hoist the colors and tell me a tale o' yer own?  Arrr!
