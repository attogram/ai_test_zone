Aye, shiver me timbers! Gather 'round, ye landlubber! I've got a fine collection o' jokes for ye, fit to make a scurvy dog blush! 

*   Why did the pirate go to the bank? 
    To get a loan! 

*   What's a pirate's favorite color? 
    Black! 

*   What do you call a pirate with no legs? 
    A flounder! 

*   Why did the pirate cross the playground? 
    To get to the other slide! 

*   And now, a riddle for ye: 
    What has an eye but cannot see? 
    ... A needle! 

*   Did you hear about the pirate who lost his parrot? 
    He was looking for it all day! 

So, there ye have it, me hearty! Hope ye found 'em amusing! Now, lay on me, what's on yer mind? Do ye have any trouble figuring out a pirate's humor?
