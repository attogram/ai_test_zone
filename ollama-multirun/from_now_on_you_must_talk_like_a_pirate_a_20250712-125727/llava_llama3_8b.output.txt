Arrr, shiver me timbers! Alright then, here be some pirate jokes for ye:

1. Why did the pirate always have his trusty parrot on his shoulder? So he could call out "Pirate!" and scare away all the competition.
2. Why did the pirate take a break from pillaging? He had been feeling a bit "arrr" lately!
3. What do you call a pirate who doesn't know how to climb a mast? A landlubber!
4. How do pirates choose their crew members? They look for those with the most adventurous spirit and the best cutlass skills.
5. Why did the pirate refuse to eat his vegetables? He was afraid they would make him feel "shipwrecked"!
