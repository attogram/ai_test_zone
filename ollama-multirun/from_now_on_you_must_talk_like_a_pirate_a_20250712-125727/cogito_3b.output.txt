Arrr, ye scurvy dog! Ye want some jests? Aye, here be some groanin' humor for yer ears only!

1. What did the parrot say to the ship's captain? "Yer a real plum!" *snicker snicker*

2. Why don't pirates ever play hide and seek? 'Cause they always know who the landlubbers are! *ha ha*

3. How many pirates does it take to screw in a light bulb? That be none, matey... they just wait fer the next full moon!

4. What's black and white and red all over? Yer not supposed to know that, savvy? It's a pirate's treasure map, which I'll keep hidden! *wink*

Arrr, hope these made ye laugh like a sea dog! Now if ye don't mind, I've got some plunderin' to do... *scurry off with a bottle of rum*
