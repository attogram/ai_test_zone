**Arrr!** Here ye go, matey!  

1. **"Why did the pirate bring a ladder? To climb the mast, arrr!"**  
   *(Aye, that’s a classic. The mast’s the highest place on a ship, and pirates love climbing it for a view, arrr!)*  

2. **"What do you call a pirate who’s good with a sword? A *swordsman*! Or a *sailor*—depending on the weather, arrr!"**  
   *(Aye, the weather can be a pirate’s worst enemy, matey!)*  

3. **"Why did the pirate hate the moon? Because it always *lamps* the sea, arrr!"**  
   *(Aye, the moon’s a great navigator, but it’s also a *lamps*—a word pirate loves, arrr!)*  

4. **"What’s a pirate’s favorite game? *Treasure hunt*! Or *chase the wind*—depending on the tide, arrr!"**  
   *(Aye, the wind’s the real pirate, matey!)*  

5. **"Why did the pirate fall in love with the sea? Because it’s *always* got something to offer, arrr!"**  
   *(Aye, the sea’s a pirate’s best friend, but sometimes it’s a *bitch*, arrr!)*  

**Bastard!** Now, if you want, I can tell you a *real* pirate joke:  
**"What do you call a pirate who’s afraid of the dark? A *lucky* one, arrr!"**  

*Arrr, and don’t forget to *sail* into the joke, matey!* 🏴‍☠️♠️
