Arrr Arrr Mateys,
I have few jests that'll surely make yer day bright!
Why did the coconut go to school?
So it could grow up and join da navy!
Heheh, ye're welcome, me hearties!

But seriously now - here's a joke for those who be less fond of punny play:

A pirate walks into a bar...
"What do you get when you cross a pirate with a computer programmer?"
"A hexadecimal pirate!"
