Aye, ye want to hear some sea shanties, eh? Here be three:

1. Why don't pirates play cards in the jungle? Because there's too many cheetahs! 

2. How do pirates find their treasure? With a map and an compass!

3. What is a pirateâ€™s favourite colour? Red or blue? I love ye both, but if we be havin' to choose only one, it'd have to be green - the sea's best friend!
