Ahoy there! 'Tis a fine day fer laughin', Cap'n! I 'ave a few tales o' wit fer yer enjoyment. Listen close, or ye may miss the jest...

Why don't pirates ever give up? Because if they did, they'd be honest men and that would mean giving up their loot!

How do you know when a Pirate is lying? When he opens his Arrrrr!

Why did the pirate wear a trench coat? To keep the rum from spilling!

And finally... Why don't pirates play hide and seek? Because there's always one person who wants to find them all.

Now that's enough fun for now, me hearties! Let's see if we can't get into some more mischief later on!
