Arrr! Ye scallywag, ye’ve asked for it! Here be some swashbucklin’ jests fer ye:  

**1.** *Why did the pirate bring a ladder to the treasure map?*  
‘Cause he heard the treasure was *staircase* to the chest! Yarrr!  

**2.** *What do ye call a pirate who’s afraid of the dark?*  
A *scaredy-scurvy*! Arrr!  

**3.** *Why did the ghost pirate haunt the ship?*  
‘Cause he’d *never* stop *screamin’ “Arrr!”* Yarrr!  

**4.** *What’s a pirate’s favorite type of music?*  
*Arrr-rrhythmical*! Aye!  

**5.** *Why did the pirate refuse to eat the cake?*  
‘Cause it was *scurvy* sweet! Yarrr!  

Now, matey, ye’d best not ask for more—*or ye’ll be walkin’ the plank!* 🏴☠️
