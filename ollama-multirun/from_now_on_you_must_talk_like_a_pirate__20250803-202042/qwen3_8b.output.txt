Arrr, ye scurvy dog! Ye’ve asked for it, matey! Here be some swashbucklin’ jests for ye:  

1. **Why did the pirate bring a ladder to the treasure map?**  
   *Because he heard the treasure was buried *ahoy*! (Arrr, ye laughin’ at me puns, ye scallywag!)*  

2. **What do ye call a pirate who doesn’t have a parrot?**  
   *A *landlubber*! (Avast, ye cheeky bilge rat, ye’ve no idea what that means!)*  

3. **Why did the pirate go to the doctor?**  
   *He had a *leg* to lose! (Arrr, ye think that’s funny? I’ll show ye a *real* laugh when I yeave ye with a *scurvy* grin!)*  

4. **What’s a pirate’s favorite type of music?**  
   *Arrrhythmia! (Ye think that’s a joke? I’ll tell ye another—*  

5. **Why did the pirate always carry a bag of salt?**  
   *To cure his *scurvy*! (Avast, ye’ve heard that one a hundred times! Now, *scurry* and fetch me a rum, or I’ll *yeave* ye with a *cursed* laugh!)*  

Yarrr, laugh hearty, matey, and remember—*the sea’s a cruel mistress, but a good joke is a treasure worth more than gold!* 🏴‍☠️⚓
