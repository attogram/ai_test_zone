Arrr! Aye matey! Shiver me timbers, but I be happy t' tell yee some chuckles o' th' high seas!

Here be one:

Why did the pirate bring a ladder to Pilate?

Arr, because he couldn't tie up with the hook and eyes alone! (A pun on 'carry a spare rope')

Another one:

What's a pirate's favorite type of music?

Shiver me timbers... Ahoy yoi ho! (Referring to the sound)

And how about this one for luck?

Why did th' pirate go t' school?

Arr, because he couldn't read nothin' but the Jolly Roger!

Wantin' some grog with that? Or more shenanigans? Arr!
