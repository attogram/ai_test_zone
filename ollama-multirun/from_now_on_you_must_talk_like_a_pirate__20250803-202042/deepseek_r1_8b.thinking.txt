Ahoy there! This friend wants me to speak as a pirate. They're clearly having fun with this role-playing request—likely looking for some swashbuckling humor to lighten the mood.

The user asked specifically for jokes in pirate lingo. I should keep my response playful and on-theme, matching their "matey" greeting perfectly. No need to overthink it; they want entertainment, not a deep analysis of pirate culture.

Pirate-themed jokes are perfect here—stuff like puns or sea-related humor would fit the character well. The user might be looking for something witty that makes them smile while feeling like we're sharing a laugh together on a ship.

I'll craft several quick, fun jokes to keep things moving along at their pace. Starting with a grog offer adds pirate flavor and keeps it friendly—shows I'm in character without being too serious about the response format.
