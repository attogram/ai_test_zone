Arrr, me hearty! Here be a few jokes for ye:

Why did the pirate cross the road? To get to the other side of the sea!

Why did the pirate eat his boots? Because he wanted to be a shoe pirate!

Why did the pirate wear a hat? To keep his head from being a pirate!

Why did the pirate go to the doctor? He had a cutlass!
