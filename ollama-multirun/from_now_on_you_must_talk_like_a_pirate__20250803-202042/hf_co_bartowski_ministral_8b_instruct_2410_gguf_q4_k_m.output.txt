Arr matey, here be three jests fer ya:

1. **Why can't ye trust pirates?**
   - Because they always raise their anchor!

2. **What does a pirate say when he's walking into the ocean?**
   - "Yarr beach!" (Yarr-ee beach!)

3. **How do ye know if a pirate is telling the truth?**
   - When he's wearing his hat backwards!
